LAB#5 INSTRUCTIONS: MANUAL CONTROL
PROF. RANTANEN
March 17, 2024
The goals of this lab are to allow you to empirically investigate the impact of various variables on your
performance in both discrete and continuous control. Instead of letting you design the experiment like in the
past, this time I have determined the manipulations to demonstrate some key effects.
1 Instructions
In this lab you will be collecting data in both discrete and continuous manual control tasks. You may work
in groups to collect the data and tabulate and plot the results. Part 1 will focus on understanding Fitts’ Law
for discrete manual control with a mouse. Part 2 will demonstrate the effects of gain, time delay, and control
order in tracking tasks.
You will be using a computer program titled “MCL200”. Unfortunately, the program only runs of Win-
dows PCs. Follow the login instructions below to begin the labs.
Login Instructions:
1. Open the folder labeled “MCL200”
2. Open the folder “Calibrations” and run the “Monitor.Cal” executable
3. Run the “MCL200” executable
1.1 Part 1: Discrete Control
The objectives of this part is to measure movement time to targets of different distances and amplitudes and
note the equivalence of the movements that have equal Index of Difficulty (ID) and to compare position and
velocity control for discrete movements. The tasks are quite difficult, so concentrate on your performance
to ensure good data. Feel free to rerun any part of the lab if you are not satisfied with your performance.
Remember to save your data when the results screen appears by clicking on “Save Data As...”. Files are
saved in the corresponding “Results” folder (i.e., Discrete Results, Pursuit Results) as .DAT files which can
be opened in Notepad.
1.1.1 Index of Difficulty (Position Control)
Follow the instructions below to load the program and set the parameters for each of the 5 conditions. For
each condition, you will be able to save your results from the 10 trials. When the results screen appears,
click the “Save Results As...” button and save the file to the Discrete Results folder.

1. From the Manual Control Task Select screen, select the “Discrete Control Task: FITT’S LAW” radio
button, then click “OK”
2. On the Discrete Task Settings menu, enter the following values for Condition 1, then click “OK” to
begin the trials (ignore the “Open Saved Settings” or “Save Settings As” buttons):
• Control Order is Zero
• Number of Trials is 10
• Target Width is 100.0
• Amplitude (to target) is 300.0
• Input Gain is 1.0
• Input Time Delay is 0.0
• Target Capture Criterion is 1.0
• Trial Timeout is 30.0
3. For Condition 2, make the following changes:
• Target Width is 50.0
• Amplitude is 150.0
4. For Condition 3:
• Target Width is 15.0
• Amplitude is 300.0
5. For Condition 4:
• Target Width is 50.0
• Amplitude is 300.0
6. For Condition 5:
• Target Width is 50.0
• Amplitude is 150.0
• Change the Input Gain to 3.0
Assignment: (1) Compute the Index of Difficulty (ID) for each of the four conditions (Conditions 1 through
4 above) and plot the average movement time (MT) as a function of ID. Do the two conditions with similar
ID also have similar MT? Is the function linear? What are the coefficients a and b in Fitts’ law? (Note:
To compute the straight line equation you can either use a statistics program and compute the regression
equation for all your data points or just choose two best-fitting points and solve the equation manually). (2)
What kind of an effect did increased gain for setting 5 have in your performance?
1.1.2 Control Dynamics
Follow the instructions below to load the program and set the parameters.
1. On the Discrete Task Settings menu, enter the following values for Condition 1, then click “OK” to
begin the trials:
• Control Order is 1st
• Target Width is 50.0
2
• Amplitude is 150.0
• Input Gain is 2.0
2. Do 3 blocks of 10 trials, recording movement time after each trial:
Assignment: (1) What kind of a learning curve do you observe? (2) Compare Block 3 MT with the
corresponding ID MT with the zero-order (position) control from part 1A (with the same ID). Which task
was harder? Why?
1.2 Part 2: Continuous Control
The objectives of this part of the lab is to demonstrate the effects of time delay, gain, and control order on
tracking performance. Remember to save your results after every set of trials as described above.
1.2.1 Compensatory Tracking: Gain and Time Delay
1. From the Manual Control Task Select screen, select the “Continuous Control Task: Compensatory
Tracking” radio button, then click “OK”
2. You will run a series of practice trials so that your tracking performance stabilizes before you run
the experimental trials (one trial per each of four conditions). If your results from the practice trials
show continuous improvement (decreasing RSME values), continue doing practice trials until the
RSMEs for your performance are pretty constant. Write down your very first practice trial RMSE for
comparison, and then the RMSEs for each of the four conditions.
3. On the Compensatory Tracking Task menu, enter the following values for the practice trials, then click
“OK” to begin the trials (ignore the “Open Saved Settings” or “Save Settings As“ buttons):
• Control Order is Zero
• Number of Axes is Single
• Disturbance Bandwidth is Low
• Number of Trials is 15
• Input Gain is 1.0
• Input Time Delay is 0.0
• Output Sample Rate is 20
• Trial Duration is 30.0
4. For Condition 1, keep the above settings, but change the following:
• Number of Trials is 1
5. For Condition 2, change the following settings:
• Input Gain is 3.0
6. For Condition 3, change the following settings:
• Input Gain is 1.0
• Input Time Delay is 0.3
7. For Condition 4, change the following settings:
• Input Gain is 3.0
3
• Input Time Delay is 0.3
Assignment: Considering your tracking in Conditions 1–4, what do you conclude about the effects of gain,
time delay, and their interaction? Plot your results for visualization of the data and easy comparison of the
effects of the experimental conditions.
1.2.2 Pursuit Tracking: Order Demonstration
In this set of trials, you will be comparing your pursuit tracking performance under various control orders.
1. First run the demonstration by selecting the “Continuous Tracking Task: ORDER DEMONSTRA-
TION” radio button and clicking “OK”.
2. Use the mouse to drag the circles back and forth. The top circle has zero control order motion (you
control the position of the circle). The middle circle has first control order motion (you control the
circle’s velocity). The bottom circle has second control order motion (you control the circle’s accel-
eration). Try to align them back on the center line.
3. Next, go back to the Pursuit Tracking task and choose the following settings for Condition 1:
• Control order is Zero
• Number of axes is Single
• Disturbance Bandwidth is Low
• Number of Trials is 15
• Input Gain is 1.0
• Input Time Delay is 0.0
• Output Sample Rate is 20
• Trial Duration is 30.0
4. For Condition 2, set Control Order to 1st
5. For Condition 3, set Control Order to 2nd
Assignment: (1) Considering your tracking in Conditions 1-3, what do you conclude about the effects of
control order on your performance? Plot your results for visualization of the data and easy comparison of
the effects of the experimental conditions. Were you aware of the demands in second order tracking? (2)
Discuss the changes you noticed in your attempts to control the cursor in each control order condition. (3)
Also, compare your results from Part 2.1 Condition 1 to those from Part 2.2 Condition 1: How was the task
different in the former (compensatory tracking) compared in the latter (pursuit tracking)? Describe this first
in qualitative terms, then show whether your data supports your description.

2 Manual Control, Supplemental Handout
To compute the Index of Difficulty (ID), you need to use a base 2 log, which cannot be found on calculators
(MS Excel could do it for you, however!). Use the following property of logarithms to change the base to
something you have in your calculators (e.g., 10, or e):
loga x = logb x
logb a (1)
where b can be any base you want (e.g., 10, or e).
To find the constants a and b in Fitts’ law you are welcome to use your favorite statistical software package
and do a linear regression on your results. For a “quick and dirty” shortcut, you may choose two represen-
tative points from the results and find the equation of the line passing through these points:
y − y1
x − x1
= y2 − y1
x2 − x1
(2)
Then put the equation in the slope-intercept form
y = ax + b (3)
and you have your constants. Do not forget to interpret the meaning of the slope (a) in the discussion.
