Word Meaning
Throughout much of this book, I have waffled on the question of whether I am
talking about concepts or words. The two seem to be closely related. I can talk
about children learning the concept of sheep, say, but I can also talk about their
learning the word sheep. I would take as evidence for a child having this concept the
fact that he or she uses the word correctly. On a purely intuitive basis, then, there
appears to be considerable similarity between word meanings and concepts. And in
fact, much of the literature uses these two terms interchangeably. In this chapter, I
will address in greater detail the relation between concepts and word meanings, and
so I will have to be somewhat more careful in distinguishing the two than I have
been. (Let me remind readers of the typographical convention I have been following
of italicizing words but not concepts.)
To discuss the relation between these two, one ought to begin by providing defi-
nitions for these terms, so that there is no confusion at the start. By concept, I mean
a nonlinguistic psychological representation of a class of entities in the world. This is
your knowledge of what kinds of things there are in the world, and what properties
they have. By word meaning, I mean quite generally the aspect of words that gives
them significance and relates them to the world. I will argue that words gain their
significance by being connected to concepts. It is important to note, however, that
this is not true by definition but needs to be argued for on the basis of evidence and
psychological theory. And that is the main goal of this chapter. More generally, the
goal is to say how it is that word meanings are psychologically represented.
As the reader will see, there is less new empirical material here than in most of the
chapters of the book. Instead, the chapter is more of an essay in which I attempt to
argue for a specific relation between word meanings and concepts. I begin by dis-
cussing notions of word meaning from psychology and linguistics and then propose
a particular kind of relation between concepts and meanings. I attempt to support
this proposal with theoretical and empirical evidence. Finally, I discuss some im-
portant topics from lexical semantics that are usually not addressed in psychological
theories of word meaning, including polysemy and lexical modulation. These phe-
nomena are critical to a complete explanation of how word meaning is related to
comprehension, even though they have not received much attention in the psycho-
logical literature.

Different Conceptions of Word Meaning
The present chapter will not provide an introduction to the study of linguistic
meaning. That is an enormous topic that has a huge literature in philosophy and
linguistics, in addition to psychology, and a single chapter cannot even mention
many of the topics in it, much less develop them in any detail. The focus of this
chapter will be on how word meanings are psychologically represented. It will not
address the meaning of larger linguistic structures (sentence, discourse, or story)
except tangentially, and it will not consider controversies involving meaning in the
philosophy of language. That said, I need to quickly review approaches to the study
of meaning outside of psychology, in part to explain why it is that cognitive scien-
tists from different perspectives have said things about meaning that seem at odds
with what I propose. The reason, in brief, is that they have goals and assumptions
that are not ours. In some cases, their enterprises are simply separate questions that
do not conflict with the psychological ones. In other cases, however, it is likely that
the two approaches will clash, and one will eventually have to give way (hopefully
theirs). But resolving such disputes will not be the focus of this chapter.
One idea that people often have about word meaning is that it is a kind of
‘‘official’’ statement of the sort that is found in dictionaries. That is, when you have
an argument with a friend over whether berm means a bank of earth or a small
stream, you would look it up in the dictionary and find out that it means the former.
Or you might have an argument over whether data is singular or plural, and check a
style manual to decide the answer. From this perspective, the meaning is whatever is
in the dictionary or other authoritative source. However, this kind of prescriptive
meaning is not what we will be talking about, though it does have some importance.
We will be talking about the meanings of words as people ordinarily use and con-
ceive of them. So, if people typically misuse a word according to the dictionary or
style manual, that is a problem for experts in usage. Psychologists are interested in
the meaning of the word represented in the person’s head—not what people are
supposed to do. 1
In linguistics and philosophy, semantics (a synonym for meaning, usually) is taken
to mean the relation between language and the world. Typically, we use language to
talk about real objects, people, events, and states. A theory of semantics, from this
perspective, is one that explains how this connection between language and the
world works. This approach is often called referential semantics, because it argues
that words get their meanings by referring to real objects and events. One reason for
framing the question of semantics this way is to explain the truth of sentences (see
Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1981). That is, a statement is true just in case it corre-
sponds to a situation in the world. Theories of semantics based on logic spell out
that correspondence. For example, if I see you opening a gate and tell you ‘‘There’s
a mad dog in that yard,’’ it would not be surprising if you were to step back and
quickly close the gate. The reason for this is that there is a reliable (though not per-
fect) relationship between this sentence and a situation in the world in which a mad
dog is to be found in a yard. The goal, then, is to explain the relationship between
mad and various mad things, between dog and kinds of animals, between in and
different spatial relations, and so on, such that the meaning of ‘‘There’s a mad dog
in that yard’’ corresponds correctly to a real-world situation of a certain kind of
animal located within a yard. (Or if it doesn’t correspond correctly, we could ex-
plain why you complained that I misled you.) For a good explanation of this aspect
of meaning, see Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (1990).
In order to explain the reliable connection between language and the world, many
philosophical theories of semantics argue that word meaning is simply a relation
between a word and the world. So, the meaning of dog is the set of dogs in the
world. Actually, the theories are somewhat more complex than this, because the set
of dogs in the world is changing all the time: New dogs are born and old ones die
every minute. Furthermore, we may talk about hypothetical or fictional dogs, which
would not be found in the world. Thus, the meaning of dog must be something
more complex, like the set of all the dogs that ever existed and that will exist, or the
set of all possible dogs (‘‘If I had a dog, it would be brown’’). In this case, as in
many others, the meaning would be an infinitely large set of objects, since there is an
infinite number of possible dogs.
Referential semantics is extremely popular in linguistics, but it is not acceptable as
a psychological theory. The reason is that people do not know or have access to
these sets of objects or events. Fortunately, I do not know all the dogs in the world,
much less all dogs that ever existed or will exist, or all possible dogs. If under-
standing the meaning of ‘‘dogs have four legs’’ requires reference to the set of all
possible dogs, then I can’t possibly comprehend this sentence, because I can’t know
all possible dogs. This approach to meaning, then, is not suitable as a psychological
theory (see Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 1990; or Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1981;
Word Meaning 387
for more detailed explanation and defense of referential semantics). It is possible
that a psychological theory will turn out to be related to the referential theory. For
example, whatever my meaning of dog is, perhaps it allows me to pick out any
possible dog, even though my meaning is not actually the set of all possible dogs. If
such a correspondence could be worked out, then separate linguistic and psycho-
logical theories might be compatible, even if they involve very different kinds of
entities (infinite sets and relations in one case, some kind of psychological represen-
tation in the other).
The psychological approach assumes that people do not know about every ex-
ample of each word they know. Instead, it assumes that people have some sort of
mental description that allows them to pick out examples of the word and to under-
stand it when they hear it. For example, I do not know all possible dogs, but I have
some description of what dog means in my mental lexicon (or dictionary) that can
be used to identify dogs. Furthermore, when people tell me things like ‘‘my dog bit
me,’’ I can understand them, because I can retrieve the mental descriptions of these
words and combine them to result in a proposition that describes the meaning of the
entire sentence. This description will be accurate enough in most cases for me to
make contact between words and the world, as referential semantics assumed. That
is, my mental descriptions of mad and dog are such that I can combine them to
identify actual mad dogs and then talk about them. So, the goal of any psychologi-
cal approach to word meaning is to specify that mental description associated with
each word, which allows people to use it.
I want to remind the reader that my taking this perspective is due to our ultimate
goal of explaining how people understand and produce words. If one has a different
goal, such as explaining how words got the meanings they have, or how meaning
relates to logical validity, one might take a very different perspective. In providing a
conceptual theory, I am not saying that it exhausts all that needs to be said about
meaning. In too many discussions of meaning, there are arguments in which writers
show that X cannot fully account for some semantic phenomenon, and so they
conclude that X is not part of a theory of meaning. My own guess is that many
different kinds of perspectives will be required to explain all of meaning. The present
perspective is the most appropriate one for addressing psychological issues.

Summary of the Conceptual View
My claim in this chapter is that word meanings are psychologically represented by
mapping words onto conceptual structures. That is, a word gets its significance by being connected to a concept or a coherent structure in our conceptual representa-
tion of the world. To put it another way, the meaning is built out of concepts. The
way that this works can be somewhat complex, and specifying it is difficult, because
(understating wildly) we do not know everything we would like to know about
conceptual structure. As a result, whatever limitations there are in our understand-
ing of concepts will be carried over onto our understanding of how concepts rep-
resent meaning. In order to clarify how the two are related, let me work through
some very simple, wrong ideas, which will illustrate why the answer must be more
complex.
One very simple idea about the relation of word meanings to concepts could be
called the ‘‘words ¼ concepts’’ idea, illustrated in figure 11.1. As the figure shows,
every concept is connected to exactly one word, and every word has exactly one
concept as its meaning. Clearly, this is oversimplified: There are synonyms and am-
biguous words in which the mapping is not one-to-one (i.e., ambiguous words must
be connected to two different concepts, and synonyms must be connected to the
same concept). However, it would be fairly simple to allow these in our system, by
listing ambiguous words twice, for example. A more serious problem with this ver-
sion of the concept-meaning relationship is that there are many concepts that do not
have a word to go with them. In fact, people have published books of concepts that
do not have words but which ought to. Some examples that were distributed over
an electronic bulletin board include:
elbonics: n. The actions of two people maneuvering for one armrest in a movie theater or
airplane seat.
pupkus: n. The moist residue left on a window after a dog presses its nose to it. 2
I, for one, was familiar with these concepts, though I never had a word for them
before reading these suggestions. Another example I have used in my courses is the clumps of dust that accumulate under beds or in closets of rooms that have wood
floors. I typically find that about half the class has a name for these things (dust
bunnies or dust monsters being the most popular), but about half does not. So, the
mapping from concepts to words is incomplete. Although every content word must
have a meaning (I will ignore primarily syntactic words like articles), this does not
mean that every concept is connected to a word. So, words 0 concepts.
A second view is illustrated in figure 11.2, in which every word is connected to
exactly one concept, even though some concepts are not labeled by words. Again,
ambiguous words are a problem here, as they have two meanings, and so must be
connected to two concepts. There is no point in pretending that the meanings of
bank are really a single concept. But if we agree to list ambiguous words twice,
maybe this view is a reasonable one: Each word has one concept that represents its
meaning. Here our ignorance of conceptual structure is something of a problem,
since it is not entirely clear what ‘‘one concept’’ is. If our conceptual system is a
highly interconnected set of facts and beliefs (as the knowledge view suggests, for
example), then picking out a single concept could be difficult, since chopping the
concept away from its connections would not correctly represent how it works
within the conceptual system. Furthermore, couldn’t it be that a word picks out part
of a concept, rather than the whole thing? For example, it seems likely to me that
the word leap refers to one part of an event concept (it talks about the jumping off
but not the landing). A word like toenail probably refers to a subsection of a con-Finally, children ﬁnd it much easier to acquire basic-level categories than more
general or more speciﬁc categories. This is true both in novel category-learning
experiments (Horton and Markman 1980) and in everyday vocabulary acquisition
(Anglin 1977; Rosch et al. 1976, Experiments 8 and 9; and many other studies—see
chapter 10). Thus this aspect of conceptual structure inﬂuences vocabulary acquisi-
tion. However, it is also true that parents tend to use basic-level names in talking to
their children (Brown 1958a)—perhaps that accounts for the acquisition data. It is
likely that this is the cart rather than the horse (see chapter 10 for discussion). That
is, children would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand other terms, and so parents speak in
a way that allows them to be understood. As a general rule, the concepts that are
most useful and easiest to learn are the ones that children learn the words for ﬁrst.
This provides further evidence that meaning is based on conceptual structure.
Conceptual Combination
The main question of conceptual combination is how people understand phrases
like apartment dog, mountain stream, peeled apple, and sport that is also a game.
The very deﬁnition of conceptual combination, then, is in linguistic terms—how
people understand phrases. As I will discuss in chapter 12, it is difﬁcult to tell
whether conceptual combination is a question of concepts or of language under-
standing. The two perspectives melt together here, suggesting that there is a very
close connection between them. Rather than repeat the information in that chapter,
I will simply point out how it relates to the issue at hand.
Typicality raises its head again here, as one of the main topics of study in con-
ceptual combination is in predicting the typicality of items in combined categories
(Hampton 1988a,b; Smith et al. 1988). Murphy (1990) found that it was more dif-
ﬁcult to understand an adjective-noun phrase when the adjective was rated as atyp-
ical of the noun than when it was rated as typical: For example, loud museum was
more difﬁcult than quiet museum. So, typicality is found in this linguistic domain as
well. I argue in chapter 12 that an understanding of conceptual combination would
require background knowledge of the sort referred to in the knowledge approach to
categorization. This is another similarity. Wisniewski and Love (1998) have argued
that the alignment of conceptual structures is important in understanding concep-
tual combinations, just as it is in other conceptual tasks.
Summary of Evidence
When one starts looking for it, there is a very large body of evidence showing that
conceptual properties inﬂuence linguistic tasks just as much as they do nonlinguistic
398 Chapter 11
thought or artiﬁcial categories. Indeed, in the concept literature, little theoretical
distinction is made between experiments using known words and those using artiﬁ-
cial materials. There isn’t one theory of concept learning or representation for dot
patterns and a qualitatively different one for nouns, say. The reason is that, as just
documented, the same phenomena occur in nonlinguistic concepts and in word use,
and so any theory of one will serve to a large degree as a theory of the other.
For any one of these cases, it is possible to devise a counterargument, and oc-
casionally one will read such counterarguments about a single such issue in the
literature. For example, perhaps linguistic categories don’t really reﬂect typicality
structure, but instead typicality differences are due to associations (e.g., robin is
more associated to bird than chicken is). Perhaps the early acquisition of basic-level
categories is a result of word frequency (parents using basic-level names more than
others). And so on. However, to put it brieﬂy, these arguments are unconvincing.
Unless there is a competing theory that says how word meanings are represented
and that also can independently ﬁnd evidence for an explanation of each of these
effects, a much more powerful explanation is that word meanings are represented
by concepts. In this way, every conceptual effect that is also found with linguistic
materials is automatically explained. If word meaning is not based on concepts, the
ﬁndings of many parallels between the two is an unbelievable coincidence. So, I
would suggest that we not believe it.
Learning Word Meanings
Word learning and conceptual development are discussed at some length in chapter
10. What I would like to do here is to discuss some theoretical questions that arise
about word learning when one takes the conceptual approach. This discussion is
largely speculative, rather than covering a well-speciﬁed area of empirical research.
However, I believe that discussion is warranted, given that there are some poten-
tially confusing problems relating word meanings and concepts in early childhood,
when both are undergoing rapid development. Those who want to know facts
should consult the earlier chapter.
From the perspective of a conceptual model of word meaning, there are two very
general (oversimpliﬁed) ways that we can think of a word’s meaning as being learned.
The ﬁrst is that one could already have a concept and then learn its a name. Mervis
(1987), for example, argues that children already have concepts for a number of
words that they learn. The word learning corresponds primarily to associating the
verbal label to this concept. For example, when her son learned the word duck,
Word Meaning 399
Mervis believed that he already knew what ducks were, because of their distinctive
shapes and behaviors and the constrained context in which he encountered them (at
the lake in the park). When he learned the word, it was just a matter of acquiring
the label for this kind of thing. 4 Furthermore, Ari’s initial use of the word duck did
not correspond to what he heard from adults, but to his own (immature) under-
standing of what ducks are. There is experimental evidence that children will ac-
quire categories without labels and then associate a new label to them when it is
provided (Merriman, Schuster, and Hager 1991). On this view, then, the name is
associated to an existing concept. E. Clark (1983) argued that children often identify
lexical gaps—things in the world that they do not know the name for—which they
then try to learn the names for or even make up their own name, if necessary. When
this occurs, the concept is driving the word-learning process.
The second general way that a word meaning could be learned is that a new
concept could be formed as a result of initial word learning. For example, if you
went to a baseball game for the ﬁrst time, you might not have the concept of a home
run.5 However, in the context of hearing people talk about home runs, you might
start to look for the distinctive attributes of home runs. By virtue of trying to under-
stand what people meant by home run, you would be forced to form a new concept.
In so doing, the usual processes of concept formation would be likely to hold. For
example, you would ﬁnd it easier to learn the new word’s meaning if you viewed
typical examples rather than atypical examples; if you were exposed to contrast
categories, you would also learn how to distinguish that word’s use from another’s;
if you saw a number of examples, you would learn the meaning better than if you
only viewed one example; and so on. So, on this second story, you don’t already
know the concept of home runs and then learn the label. Instead, you hear the label
a number of times and then try to work out what the concept behind it must be.
I would argue that the typical word-learning situation combines aspects of both
ways of learning a new word. It is probably relatively rare that we have the correct
already-formed concept ready to attach to a word; it is also probably rare that we
really have no inkling of the concept before we hear the word. For example, imagine
that you are a young child living in a big city. Further suppose that you are taking a
trip to the country with your parents, and that you are going to learn the words cow
and horse as a result of this trip. It is unlikely that you have no concepts at all cor-
responding to these things, because no doubt you have seen pictures of them, heard
the words used, seen them on TV, and so on. On the other hand, you may not know
much about them besides the fact that both are large four-legged mammals. Some of
400 Chapter 11
these animals appear to be fatter and slower than others, but that’s true of many
kinds of animals—it doesn’t necessarily put them in different categories.
On your trip to the country, then, you’ll see cows and horses up close, and you
may now be better able to spot some of the intrinsic differences between them. You
can start to notice important differences based solely on exposure to the objects. (As
we know from chapter 9, even infants can do this.) At the same time, your parents
will name some of these animals for you. Since the labels cow and horse that you
hear probably do not map perfectly onto any pre-existing classes you may have
formed, you will look for differences between the objects so labeled (Clark 1983).
That is, the use of distinctive names may force you to distinguish these somewhat
similar concepts, whereas you might not have done so or might have taken longer to
do so if you had not been learning the names. So, name-learning can inﬂuence or
cause category acquisition, based in part on differences you were already noticing in
any case: The fat animals with the udders seem somewhat different from the thinner
ones without the udders; the ﬁrst sometimes moo and the second neigh. The inﬂu-
ence of the word does not in this case cause you to form an entirely new concept but
may help you learn which of the apparent distinctions are important. For example,
you can’t distinguish which things are called cow and which horse based on their
color, but you can based (partly) on the presence of horns. You can’t distinguish
them based on location, but you can (partly) based on whether they are being rid-
den. So, the names focus your attention on the features that are most useful for dis-
tinguishing the things being named and thereby inﬂuence the categories you form.
In this way, category learning and name learning can go hand in hand, sometimes
over a very extended period. There is no simple relationship between the learning of
the name and learning of the concept. In some cases, the categories are probably
learned as a response to hearing different names. In other cases, children may notice
an interesting difference between categories and then ask about it or realize that it
corresponds to a naming difference. For example, a child may notice that a chihuahua
looks different from other dogs and therefore become very receptive to learning a
new name for it, or may even ask ‘‘What’s that?’’ The linguistic input now might
just be a label for the concept he or she has already formed. In most cases, the full
meaning of the word is probably not acquired immediately, as some categories can
take much time to fully grasp (e.g., the distinction between geese, ducks, and swans),
especially if their members are not encountered that often. All this is due to the fact
that children are learning about the world—and in particular, the classes of entities
in the world and their properties—at the same time they are learning language. What
Word Meaning 401
they learn in one feeds back to the other in an interactive way. This story would be
much simpler if only children would ﬁrst learn all about the world without learning
any words. Perhaps after passing a standardized test, they would be deemed ready
to learn the words for the things they know. Then language acquisition would be
a simple case of paired-associate learning, in which a new label would have to be
learned as the name of a known concept. However, language is so useful as a tool of
learning that it would be very difﬁcult to learn all one’s concepts without it. But this
makes our story much more complex because when children ﬁrst acquire the mean-
ing of a word, they are likely not to have the full concept yet.
In short, both vocabulary learning and concept acquisition are moving targets. As
conceptual structure develops, word meanings have to change to reﬂect that devel-
opment. But as word learning progresses, this also creates changes in conceptual
structure.
A ﬁnal complication of the relation between concepts and word learning involves
certain peculiar errors children make in using words, especially at the very begin-
ning of word use. It is well known that children make overextensions and under-
extensions, or applying a word too widely and too narrowly, respectively. In fact,
for any word, a child is likely to do both—include some objects that are not cor-
rectly labeled by the word, and exclude some objects that should be included
(Anglin 1977; Clark 1973). Some of these errors are perfectly understandable as
limitations of the child’s concepts (Mervis 1987). For example, if a European child
does not recognize an ostrich as a bird, this would be completely consistent with the
concept of birds that the child has formed based on his or her everyday experience.
In fact, such developments point out one advantage of the conceptual view,
namely that as concepts change, word use will automatically change along with
them. For example, as a child learns what the critical properties are to being a bird
(or to being any biological kind), his or her use of the word bird will change along
with it. So, when the child begins to understand the importance of feathers to birds,
he or she now knows not to call planes or bats birds. Learning new facts will be
reﬂected in language use, since the facts are incorporated into conceptual structure,
which is the basis of word meaning.
Harder to explain are cases in which children use words to refer to objects that
are of drastically different types. Clark (1973) provides a summary of many diary
studies of early word use, and some of the children’s overextensions are worrisome.
For example, a child’s word for the moon was also applied to cakes, round marks
on a window, writing on windows and books, round shapes in books, and the letter
O. Another child used the word ﬂy to refer to ﬂies, specks of dirt, dust, small insects,
402 Chapter 11
his own toes, crumbs, and a toad. If we take these referents to indicate the child’s
categories, this would suggest that children’s concepts are profoundly and quali-
tatively different from those of adults, a conclusion that is at odds with most studies
of children’s concepts (see chapter 10). So, one could argue, this means that the
word meanings are not truly picking out the child’s concepts.
There are two problems with this conclusion. The ﬁrst is that the concept the
child may be using could be perfectly normal but simply the wrong one. For the case
of moon described above, the child is probably using the word to refer to an adjec-
tive concept of roundness rather than as an object concept referring to a type of ce-
lestial body. The child does not really think that the letter O, cakes, and the moon
are all the same thing, but she does think that they are all the same shape. Similarly,
the ﬂy example suggests that the child is using this word to refer to some category of
small, dirty things. The fact that the child used the word ﬂy, which normally refers
to a category of insects, makes us look for a similar object category behind his uses
of this word. But there is no reason to assume that the child is using the word to
refer to an object category, as it could be an adjective concept (presence of dirt?)
instead.
The second problem with this conclusion is that children’s intentions often go
beyond mere labeling of an object, but this is often difﬁcult to tell when they are
capable of saying only one or two words in an utterance. For example, if a child
points at a bare foot and says ‘‘shoe,’’ she might be indicating that she has a strange
word meaning that consists of feet and shoes. However, the child also might not be
labeling the foot but could be making a comment, such as ‘‘You don’t have your
shoe on,’’ or ‘‘You put shoes on your feet.’’ The child could intend a directive, such
as ‘‘Put your shoe on!’’ On the basis of a single short utterance, it is sometimes hard
to tell what the child thinks the word really means. For example, the child who used
ﬂy to refer to a toad could have been talking about the toad eating a ﬂy. There is a
general problem that young children with few words must adapt the words they
know to refer to a much wider range of meanings that they would like to commu-
nicate. So, even a child who can plainly see that a cow is not a dog may call the cow
doggie, because that is the only word he or she has for any mammal. However, the
same child may show good discrimination of cows and dogs in a comprehension
task (see Anglin 1977; Clark 1983; Gelman et al. 1998).
In short, children’s spontaneous labeling should not be taken as direct evidence
of conceptual structure, especially when their vocabulary is very small. When they
seem to be evincing some peculiar category structure, a more careful test needs to be
done to discover whether the labeling is due to a reasonable, but incorrect meaning,
Word Meaning 403
to communicative pressure, or to the intention to make a comment about something
rather than label it.

Elaborations of Word Meaning
Now that the reader is fully convinced that word meanings are constructed from
conceptual structures (or is at least tired of reading about it), I will turn to more
specific phenomena and models of the psychology of word meanings. Much of this
discussion is an attempt to bridge the gap between the static representation of words
in the head and the dynamic process of comprehension, which colors our inter-
pretations of words in actual discourse and text.
For the most part, I have been talking here as if each word is related to a single
concept. If only this were true! I am not worried here about ambiguous words like
bank. These are not really a problem, because their meanings are so distinct that
there is little chance of confusing them. Most linguists would argue that the different
uses of bank (financial institution and side of a river) are simply different words that
happen to have the same phonology, for historical reasons. Therefore, its different
meanings do not have to be coordinated in the lexicon. What is a problem for us to
explain is unambiguous words that have complex meanings.
Much of this complexity falls under the rubric of polysemy, which means ‘‘many
meanings,’’ and which refers to a word having a number of senses 6 that seem to be
related but that are also distinguishable. Polysemy should not be used to indicate
true ambiguity of the bank sort, where the meanings are unrelated. Virtually every
content word of English is polysemous to some degree. Let’s consider some exam-
ples. The word table appears to be a straightforward, simple word. However, if we
start to think about it (and, I confess, if we consult a dictionary), we can come up
with a number of distinct senses of this word, including:
. a four-legged piece of furniture: ‘‘Put it on the table.’’
. the class of all such items: ‘‘The table is America’s most popular furniture.’’
. a painting, sculpture or photograph of the piece of furniture: ‘‘The table is painted
very soulfully.’’
. the stuff that makes up a table: ‘‘After the explosion, there was table all over the
ceiling.’’
. the setting of a dinner table: ‘‘The table is not suitable for company; get the good
silverware.’’
. food served at the table: ‘‘Count Drago keeps the best table in the country.’’
. the company of people eating at a table: ‘‘The entire table shared the pate´.’’
404 Chapter 11
. a flat or level area: ‘‘The ranch sits on a table of land south of the mountains.’’
. an arrangement of words or numbers, usually in columns: ‘‘Table 3 shows the
results of the experiment.’’
. a synopsis: ‘‘The table of contents is incomplete.’’
. (verb) to propose something and (verb) to put something aside (depending on
dialect): 7 ‘‘That motion has been tabled.’’
In addition to these common senses, there are also a number of technical ones (listed
in the dictionary), which are presumably known to some speakers if not to all.
. the leaves of a backgammon board

Imagine, then, that we have a subject who is a backgammon-playing jeweler who
is also a native speaker of English. What is her meaning for the word table? It must
include the central, specific uses (as in kitchen table), uses related to the central ones
(people sitting at the table), representations (pictures of tables, presentations of re-
sults), technical uses (parts of diamonds), verb meanings, and so on. This meaning is
a mess. It is not a single concept by any stretch of the imagination. Furthermore,
among common words in English, this is a very typical situation. 8 For example,
Caramazza and Grober (1976) analyzed the word line and found 26 senses. They
reported finding 40 senses for run. Perhaps surprisingly, it is the most common
words that tend to be the most polysemous (Zipf 1945). (You can check this by
looking up common and uncommon words in the dictionary and just counting the
number of entries they have. The difference is obvious.) So, this is not a phenome-
non that can be swept under the carpet, because it must be solved by language users
every time they encounter a polysemous word. That is, if I say ‘‘I’m putting this on
the table,’’ you must identify which sense of table I intend here, as it is a very dif-
ferent thing to add data to an array of numbers than to put an object on a back-
gammon board or to submit something for consideration.
There are two main questions to be asked here, and it is important not to con-
fuse them. One is a purely psychological question, namely, how you represent the
meaning of table so that you can understand its different uses. The second is why
and how it is that word meanings get extended to have these different senses. The
latter is not a purely psychological question but a question about the process of
meaning change in a language—that is, part of linguistics (see Sweetser 1990, for an
interesting discussion). Although I think that the second is also subject to psycho-
Word Meaning 405
logical constraints (Murphy 1997a), we will focus on the first question here. How-
ever, the fact of polysemy reveals that it is apparently easier for people to take old
words and extend them to new meanings than to invent new words (see also
Markman and Makin 1998). Over the course of the history of English, it was found
to be efficient to extend the word table from its usual meanings to the meaning of a
face of a jewel and a display of information. Speakers could have invented a new
word, or borrowed one from another language, or used a longer expression (‘‘half
of a backgammon board’’), and so on. But given the very high level of polysemy in
the language, using the old words is apparently the preferred route even if it results
in very complex word meanings.
One thing to notice about the different senses of a polysemous word is that al-
though they are related, they can end up picking out very different things (Nunberg
1979; Taylor 1995). There is an obvious relation between the piece of furniture and
the people seated around that piece of furniture, but these are also very different
kinds of entities. One is a single object, and the other is a set of individuals; one is
inanimate, the other is animate; one is defined by its shape and function, the other
by its present location. To put it another way, these senses pick out entirely different
categories. The same is true of the representation sense (a painting of a table would
not make a good table), the table-setting sense, the jewelry sense, and the verb
senses. Although it is not entirely clear whether we should consider the noun and
verb forms of table as belonging to the same word (Caramazza and Grober 1976
argue that we should, but the forms must be separated at some level for syntactic
processing), one can see that they are related meanings, even though they are very
different categories (objects vs. actions).
Given this difference in the kinds of things picked out by different senses, it is in-
escapable that the word table must pick out a number of different concepts. Rather
than there being some constant meaning across all uses of table, there must be at
least a few different concepts being used. This process has sometimes been called
chaining (Lakoff 1987; Taylor 1995). The idea is that a word with a certain use
might then be extended to refer to a related kind of thing; this new use can then be
extended to something that is related to that; and so on. With enough links in the
chain, one word can get extremely different senses, even though the adjacent senses
are related (Nunberg 1979). For example, Cruse (1986, p. 73) pointed out: n the case of mouth, if one knew what an animal’s mouth was, and one were to hear, for the
first time, a reference to the mouth of a river, I surmise that there would be little difficulty in
construing the meaning; but suppose one were familiar only with mouth used to refer to the
mouth of a river, and one heard a reference to the horse’s mouth, it is by no means certain
that one’s attention would be directed to the appropriate end of the horse!

Similarly, a word like paper can refer to a substance made of wood pulp (‘‘This shirt
is actually made of paper’’) and also to the editorial policy of a newspaper (‘‘That
paper is biased against the president’’). It is easy to reconstruct the chain of mean-
ings that leads to these two senses (i.e., from the wood pulp substance to sheets
printed from that substance, to a publication printed on those sheets, to the man-
agement that produces that publication, to their editorial policy), but it is striking
that two extremely different concepts get picked out by the same word. In anyone’s
concepts, wood pulp is not much like editorial policy. It is perhaps not surprising,
then, that subjects rarely treat different senses of the same word as being in the same
category in a standard category sorting task (Klein and Murphy, in press).
A few linguists have argued that different senses of a word really reflect a com-
mon core meaning, which is found in every use of the word (most notably Ruhl
1989). However, examples of the sort given above cast strong doubt on this theory
(Rice 1992). In fact, these kinds of examples make one wonder if there is any limit
on what senses could be stuck together in a single word. Generally, we can assume
that a word will only be extended to something that is related to its other uses. But
words that have very distant senses like line or paper show that all of the meanings
do not need to be similar. Rather, it seems necessary only that any sense be predict-
able from the other senses you know (Nunberg 1989). That is, if you knew only
the meaning of chicken referring to a barnyard animal, could you understand what
someone meant when they said that there was chicken in the stew? Even though the
stew does not appear to contain a whole chicken of the sort you are familiar with,
you could infer that it is the meat of the chicken that has been incorporated into the
stew, rather than the whole animal. 9
The process of chaining has been supported by the findings of Malt et al. (1999),
who looked at the names given to a set of objects they collected from supermarkets,
kitchens, and magazines. All of these were containers of some sort, but they received
a variety of different names, such as bottle, container, jar, jug, and box. In many
cases, these items were variations on older technology, and so they did not exist
when these words first came into use. That is, a plastic juice container in the shape
of a cartoon character (labeled a juice box by subjects) is something that did not
exist ten years ago, much less when the words bottle or box first came into use.
Thus, using one of these words to refer to this new object is an example of chaining.
The invention of an object leads to a change of meaning when an old word is ex-
tended to cover this new thing.
Malt et al. found that the names for these objects could be best predicted by the
names of their neighbors via a chaining process. It was not generally the case that all
Word Meaning 407
boxes were similar to a prototypical box. Rather, the plastic cartoon-character juice
container was thought to be similar to other plastic juice boxes (without the cartoon
character but containing juice and a straw), which were similar to cardboard juice
boxes, which were similar to the most typical box (e.g., an open, squarish cardboard
box). Malt et al. suggested that when a new form of packaging was developed, it
took its name from the most closely related item. In some cases, it is not clear
whether this is an on-going psychological process, or a historical process. That is, do
people looking at a novel shampoo container think (in essence) ‘‘It’s very much like
other shampoo bottles, so I’ll call it a bottle’’? Alternatively, perhaps the manufac-
turer, which has been putting shampoo into bottles for 25 years, decides to call its
new containers bottles as well, which therefore becomes the conventional name for
it. Perhaps a small number of individuals decide on the name, which is then adopted
by the community at large, without considerable thought on their part.
What does all this mean in terms of psychological representation? First, as noted,
the word meaning is not a single concept or conceptual core. At least, no such core
has been suggested for words like table, paper or line that would cover all their
meanings. For such words there must be a one-to-many mapping from words to
concepts. Given that, the learning problem is not exactly as we have been assuming
earlier in the chapter, in which one simply (ha!) had to figure out which concept a
word corresponded to. Now, one has to distinguish different senses and identify the
concepts for each of them. So, after learning the word table as referring to kitchen,
dining room, and coffee tables, the child also has to learn the sense in which it refers
to people seated at the table. And in some cases, these senses must be kept separate,
because they are fairly distinct. That is, one usually doesn’t use the word table to
simultaneously refer to the conglomeration of the people and the object (a restau-
rant server wouldn’t say ‘‘The table is wobbly and wants to share the appetizers’’;
see Cruse 1986).
It is likely, however, that learning each specific sense is not necessary for all sorts
of polysemy. Some patterns of polysemy are very common across the language
(Nunberg 1979), and they can be immediately extended to other words. Imagine
that you just saw an unusual animal at the zoo, about which you overheard some-
one say ‘‘Look at the zork.’’ Although you have only heard this word used to refer
to a single animal, you would no doubt immediately understand uses that refer to
the entire class of animals (‘‘Zorks have only one kidney’’), to representations of the
animal (‘‘My zork is the best sculpture in the show’’), or to the meat of the animal
(‘‘Zork tastes kind of like chicken’’). This is because these types of polysemy are
found over and over in the language.
408 Chapter 11
Indeed, Murphy (1997) found that people are very willing to extend new words
in familiar ways of this sort, even though they had never heard them used in such
uses—analogous to the zork example. These extensions may be driven by a kind of
meaning-extension schema, for example, one that says that the name of an individ-
ual object can be used to refer to the whole class of such objects. In Murphy’s ex-
periment these senses could not have been learned from observation, because the
words had never been observed in these uses. So, some of our meaning extensions
are not directly learned and encoded in memory but are derived on the spot. To give
a real-life example, it seems extremely likely that once DVDs (Digital Video Discs)
become popular (as of this writing, they are not quite yet), people will sponta-
neously say things like ‘‘I saw a great DVD last night,’’ referring to the content of
the DVD. That is, they will use the word DVD polysemously to refer to the object
and its content, just as they do with CD, book, or film.
Confusing matters somewhat are cases in which one cannot extend a word in the
way one might expect to be able to. For example, we often extend the meaning of a
name for a tool to mean the normal action of using that tool. You can hammer a nail
with your shoe; or you can truck a package across town in your car. Such exten-
sions are productive and predictable, yet some such extensions are not possible. We
do not say that we ovened the bread or that we carred the passengers. The reason
for this is the phenomenon of preemption (Clark and Clark 1979; Lehrer 1990),
namely that one cannot give a word a meaning that another word already has. The
word bake already means to cook something in an oven; therefore, we cannot use
oven as a verb with this meaning. We cannot say that we carred the passengers, be-
cause the verb drive would do perfectly well in this situation. So, one constraint on
extending a word to new senses is that the sense cannot match the meaning of
another word.
The psychological question that arises from this discussion is how stored and
derived meanings combine to produce the correct sense of a word when it is used.
That is, do people have a listing in their mental lexicon for chicken of the sense
‘‘meat of a chicken’’ or do they derive it from the possibly more basic meaning of
the animal? In the zork example (hearing the word only once in a zoo), we can be
sure that people derive the meat sense from the animal sense, because we know they
have never heard the word used in the meat sense. The new sense could not have
been stored in the lexicon, and so it must have been derived from a more general
principle. Perhaps this approach is quite general. Even very conventional meanings
might be derived from more general reasoning about what the word must mean. For
example, Clark (1991) discusses the example of names for skin color. Typically,
Word Meaning 409
people of different races are referred to as having white, black, yellow, or red skin in
spite of the fact that actual skin color is generally not at all close to these colors.
How is it that white can be the name of a skin color (in addition to its normal
usage), when in fact the people described are often pink or beige or a motley col-
lection of colors? Clark argues that of the skin colors we are familiar with, one color
is closest to being white, and so we can identify it as being the one talked about.
Furthermore, the word white is probably more familiar and shorter than a more
accurate color description would be. Finally, the interpretation of white as a skin
color depends in part on the other familiar skin color terms, so that it includes fairly
dark-skinned Mediterranean peoples, for example, because they are not covered by
black or red.
Clark does not turn this point into a specific proposal for processing of these
words, but if we were to do so, it would suggest that most polysemy is not stored in
the lexicon but is figured out on the fly, using the kind of reasoning process just
described. However, I suspect that Clark’s analysis is more likely to apply to the
question of how conventional word senses develop historically in the language rather
than to explain how people understand the words in fast-moving conversations.
That is, people have heard the words white and black used to refer to skin colors
hundreds or even thousands of times. It would be peculiar if they did not at some
point develop a memory structure that stored this particular word sense but instead
kept deriving it time after time. It seems unlikely that people will think, even im-
plicitly, when they hear someone described as white, ‘‘Although his skin is not
actually white, the light skin of Caucasians is closer to being white than it is to other
basic color terms, and white is a more familiar word than . . . .’’ Above I noted that
we could use the word zork to refer to the meat of a zork even if we had never heard
the word used that way. But with very common uses, we may bypass this derivation
process and simply store the result. Since we talk about chicken meat more often
than we talk about the animal (in my house, anyway), it is likely that we have
formed the specific representation of chicken meaning chicken meat, rather than
drawing an inference something like ‘‘She could not mean for me to chop up a
whole live chicken here, so perhaps she is just referring to the meat of the breast of a
chicken, which I happen to have in the refrigerator,’’ every time chicken is used to
refer to meat. Again, after a few hundred uses of the word to refer to meat, people
probably have learned this convention, even if it is derivable from general principles
(Kawamoto 1993).
Experiments by Klein and Murphy (2001) suggest that some senses of a poly-
semous word are stored separately, rather than derived. They found priming when a
410Chapter 11
word was used twice in the same sense and interference when the word was switched
from one sense to another. These results seem most consistent with the idea that the
senses are represented and accessed separately rather than being derived each time
they are encountered. In fact, the priming pattern for polysemous words like paper
was very similar to that of homonyms like bank (though cf. Pickering and Frisson
2001).
The linguistic literature has generally focused on two possibilities: whether the
different senses of a polysemous word are stored in the lexicon or are derived (e.g.,
Rice 1992; Ruhl 1989). However, it is possible or even likely that there is a con-
tinuum between these situations. Clearly, if you extend the new words DVD or zork
to have a different meaning than you have ever heard before, you are deriving the
new meaning. If you daily use the word chicken to indicate a kind of meat, you have
probably stored this sense in your lexicon. But in between these cases may be words
that have been extended only a few times and so are somewhat familiar in a differ-
ent sense but are not very strongly represented in that sense. For example, perhaps
you have only heard a few times the word elm to refer to a type of wood, but have
often used it to refer to a type of tree. If I said to you ‘‘This table is made from elm,’’
you would have two ways of understanding this: the general principle that a name
for a plant can also be used to refer to the substance that makes up that plant and
retrieving the lexical entry saying that elm can refer to a kind of wood. Because the
use of elm to refer to a kind of wood is not very well established in your lexicon, it
may not dominate the comprehension process. That is, it may be that both of these
processes are used in understanding the word in this way. There is as yet no experi-
mental evidence that illuminates how these different sources of information are com-
bined during comprehension.
It should be pointed out that at least some uses of words must be derived, namely
what are often called nonce uses, in which a word or expression is used to have a
meaning that is peculiar to that particular occasion (Clark 1983). For example,
consider the case of a man who mainly paints still-lifes as his hobby. His wife
mainly paints gardens and farms. If the man’s wife was trying to get him to change,
he might say, ‘‘She wants us to paint the same things. She’s trying to turn me into a
farmer’’ (Gerrig 1989, p. 199). Here, farmer doesn’t mean anything that is stored in
our lexicon: It means ‘‘someone who paints farms.’’ This, however, is a use that can
only be understood within that particular context, rather than being derivable from
the meaning of farm on general principles. Not surprisingly, such innovations are
usually somewhat harder to understand than using the word in its usual sense (for
farmer, ‘‘someone who runs a farm’’) (Gerrig 1989). However, they can nonetheless
Word Meaning 411
be understood, and in some situations are very common indeed. For example, it is
common (in English) to take a noun and turn it into a verb, as in ‘‘The boy has been
porching the newspaper recently’’ (Clark and Clark 1979; Clark 1983). The ease
with which such innovations get uttered and understood reflects the constructive
aspects of meaning, in which information from the discourse itself (say, a discussion
about newspaper delivery) and from general world knowledge (that boys often de-
liver newspapers by tossing them near the front door) are accessed to construct a
specific meaning that is not already in the lexicon (toss onto the porch). Such con-
structive processes are probably the same sort that are used in contextual modula-
tion more generally, as will be discussed in the next section.
In summary, then, polysemy creates a real problem for any theory of word mean-
ing, because it can result in radically different senses being picked out by the same
word. Even though the senses are usually related to one another, perhaps through a
chain of similarities, the categories of things being referred to can be very different.
Polysemy has not received the attention it deserves in psychological theories of word
meaning, and this is why this section of the chapter is heavy on linguistic examples
and general pronouncements, and light on evidence. My analysis suggests that both
main proposals for how polysemy could be handled are probably true. In some
cases, the sense must be derived, and in others it is most likely retrieved from the
lexicon. But the variables influencing each and the interaction of the two processes
are simply unknown. The field will need to address this problem, because theories of
word meaning that neglect polysemy cannot be complete. Furthermore, any attempt
to build a computational language-comprehension device obviously cannot be suc-
cessful if it ignores this issue. Perhaps it is from this direction that more concrete
suggestions for handling the problem will come.
Indeed, Kawamoto (1993) touched on polysemy in his connectionist model of
ambiguity resolution. The model represents semantics as a kind of space of features
and feature combinations, and a given concept is a location in space corresponding
to its particular set of features. This location is not a single point, however, but an
area that encompasses all the related uses of the word. Although dog might refer
to animals of a single species with many common properties, the individuals referred
to also differ in size, color, personalities, behaviors, and so on, and so different uses
of the word dog might pick out slightly different locations in space. According to
Kawamoto, different senses of a polysemous word will become established in the
lexicon when they are distinct enough and frequent enough to establish their own
‘‘local minimum’’ in that space. If there is a clump of uses of a word that is notice-
ably distinct from another clump of uses (e.g., chicken referring to an animal vs. the
412 Chapter 11
meat), the model will act as if there are two different senses. If the uses are infre-
quent and evenly spread throughout the space, then the model will not distinguish
different senses. Although Kawamoto (1993) did not implement his ideas about
polysemy in his running model, this is an interesting proposal that has the prospect
of dissolving some of the fuzzy distinctions of senses that arise in this topic. That
is, rather than worrying about whether two similar uses of a word are the same or
different senses and therefore whether they are represented separately, the model
would directly represent the continuum of word uses.
A final issue is how the phenomenon of polysemy speaks to the question of the
conceptual basis of word meaning. Clearly, it complicates matters considerably.
However, the complication is not due to representing meanings by concepts but is in
the actual structure of the lexicon. The fact that people use words like paper to refer
to a substance, a copy of a daily publication, and an editorial policy means that the
word’s representation must be complex. The conceptual theory provides some basis
for the complexity of the meaning, because one can see the relation between the
senses in terms of their content. That is, it is because a publishing company estab-
lishes its editorial policy, which it prints in individual copies of a newspaper, which
are made up of that substance, that the same word can be used to refer to all these
things (see Pustejovsky 1995). In contrast, imagine we had a referential theory in
which words were defined by the objects they picked out. There is no overlap be-
tween newspaper companies and copies of a newspaper or between editorial policy
(indeed, it is not clear what its reference would even be) and a paper presented at a
conference. Thus, the referential theory cannot explain why it is that the same word
is used to refer to these different concepts, whereas the conceptual basis of word
meaning at least has some basis for explaining the phenomenon of polysemy. This is
not to say that it is completely understood, as linguistic study of the topic continues,
and psychological study is just beginning. However, the conceptual basis of meaning
at least provides a way of addressing the problem.

Modulation of Meaning
As we have already seen, words do not mean the same thing in different situations.
Usually, it is the context, the setting and speakers or the rest of the sentence, that
tells us which sense is the right one. If I say ‘‘The dog is in the yard,’’ it is easy to
infer that I must be intending dog to refer to an individual dog rather than to the
class of all dogs, because it is very likely that an individual dog but not the entire
class of dogs is in the yard. Furthermore, if I own a dog, and the person I’m talking
Word Meaning 413
to knows this, then the person can further infer that I am talking about my particu-
lar dog. Similarly, a reference to chicken made in the kitchen probably picks out the
meat sense, but outside on a farm, the animal sense is more likely. So, context can
act to select the intended word sense. However, context can also specify in much
more detail what is meant by a word, as I will discuss.
Interactional Effects on Meaning
Before getting to that, however, these issues must be put into a broader context.
There is a tradition within experimental psychology of studying language in highly
decontextualized settings. Typically, words or sentences appear on a computer screen
with no apparent speaker, and the subject must make a judgment about the stimuli
rather than responding as if the text were part of a normal conversation. Such a situ-
ation removes many critical aspects of language use, which some researchers have
argued distorts our understanding of language processing. Clark (1996) describes
many of these aspects. One concern that is relevant to our present discussion has
to do with the differences in word meanings across communities. People who share
experiences, specialized knowledge, hobbies, religion, and so on, may use words in
a different way than those who do not share those things. If you and I are both
jewelers, then you may understand my use of the word table to refer to a facet of a
gem rather than a piece of furniture. If you didn’t think I was a jeweler, you might
not understand my using the word in this way. People choose the vocabulary ap-
propriate to the situation and their audience, and listeners understand words in the
appropriate senses for those situations. In the most specific case, a word’s meaning
is only fully known to the people involved in the conversation. For example, Garrod
and Anderson (1987) had pairs of subjects solve a maze task. Different pairs used
different and incompatible terms to describe the parts of the maze. If a sentence said
by a speaker in one pair had been heard by a different pair, they would have mis-
understood what was being described. More generally, during referential com-
munication tasks, speakers start with long descriptions but soon shorten them to
abbreviated versions that could not be understood without having heard the earlier,
complete version (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986; Krauss and Weinheimer 1966).
It is the earlier history of the conversation that allows the shortened version to be
understood.
Exactly how people manage to keep track of all these different influences is a
matter of some controversy (see Keysar et al. 2000; Polichak and Gerrig 1998). The
controversy surrounds how fast and accurate people are at keeping track of all the
information they share with people they are speaking with (e.g., Paul is a psycholo-
414 Chapter 11
gist, soccer fan, and father, like me, but isn’t at my university or town, doesn’t share
my religion or interest in beer, etc.). Does the jeweler who hears someone refer to a
table mistakenly think that a jewel face is being referred to before realizing that the
speaker is not a jeweler? Such psychological issues surrounding the production and
comprehension of words are not yet settled. However, it is nonetheless clear that
speakers and listeners use words differently depending on their shared communities
and prior discourse.
Having said all that, I must point out that the psychology of concepts is of limited
help in explaining some of these phenomena. If word meaning is built out of con-
ceptual structures, this tells us that the senses of table must all be represented in
conceptual units, for universally known senses as well as novel meanings that have
arisen in a discourse. However, the psychology of concepts simply is little help in
explaining the nature of personal interactions, episodic memories, and the prior
discourse that influences meaning, because these are not conceptual factors. As a
result, the remainder of this section focuses on factors more directly related to one’s
conceptual and world knowledge. These influences arise not from interactions with
a specific person but from more general knowledge of words in a sentence. Ulti-
mately, both this sort of knowledge and information about one’s interlocutor will
need to be integrated in a complete model of language use.

Contextual Modulation
In many cases, a word that has a general meaning is actually understood in a more
specific way when it occurs in a conversation. For example, Anderson and Ortony
(1975) contrasted the sentences, ‘‘The accountant pounded the stake’’ and ‘‘The
accountant pounded the desk.’’ The action of pounding that we get from these
sentences is somewhat different. And indeed, Anderson and Ortony found that a
word like hammer was a better recall cue for the first sentence than for the second
in a later memory test. 10 This suggests that when the subjects read these sen-
tences, they elaborated the meaning of pounded so that it had a more detailed rep-
resentation, based on the situation that the sentence evoked. This process is called
contextual modulation (Cruse 1986) or modification. In the first case, pounded is
modulated to include hitting with a mallet or hammer, whereas in the second case,
the same word is understood to involve hitting with a fist, though neither of these is
explicitly said.
Roth and Shoben (1983) used measures of category structure to study contextual
modulation. They presented subjects with sentences containing a category name and
then asked them to rate the typicality of different category members. For example:
(4) During the midmorning break, the two secretaries gossiped as they drank the
beverage.
(5) Before starting his day, the truck driver had the beverage and a donut at the
truck stop.
Roth and Shoben predicted that tea would be a more likely beverage than milk for
sentence (4) but that milk would be more typical than tea for sentence (5). Indeed,
when subjects were asked to rate the typicality of items as being in the category
named in the sentence, this is just what was found. More importantly, when subjects
read a subsequent sentence referring to tea or milk, the tea sentence was easier fol-
lowing sentence (5) above, but the milk sentence was easier following sentence (4).
That is, even though the same category name, beverage, is used in (4) and (5),
readers apparently interpret this word more specifically, based on what particular
beverages they think are more likely to be drunk in the described situation. This
particular result is therefore directly related to category structures, suggesting that
the Garrod and Sanford (1977) result described earlier can be modulated by con-
text. That is, people will not simply read the word tank more slowly than bus when
they are thinking of a vehicle; this result can be changed depending on which kind
of vehicle seems more likely in the described situation. (See also Barsalou 1991, for
more on contextual changes in category structure, though not specifically related to
language.)
This process of contextual modulation of word meaning is not confined to gen-
eral category terms like beverage. In fact, Cruse (1986) suggests that ‘‘the meaning
of any word form is in some sense different in every distinct context in which it
occurs’’ (p. 51). We should not overplay this point, as some of the differences in
meanings can be very subtle indeed. However, we should not ignore the effect, either,
which is more often done. Let’s just consider a few examples to get a sense of the
differences in meaning:
(6) Audrey is visiting her mother in San Diego.
(7) Audrey is visiting her friend this evening.
(8) Audrey is visiting her bank.
(9) Audrey is visiting Madagascar.
Although the same verb visiting is used in each case, the act of visiting is somewhat
different, due to the differences in the object of the verb and in the time specified
(if any). So, Audrey’s visiting her mother in San Diego (said in Illinois) probably
involves staying at her mother’s house and spending considerable time on and off with her mother over the course of several days. But in visiting her friend this eve-
ning, Audrey is probably spending a continuous, but much shorter time with her
friend, perhaps engaged in a specific activity (dinner, a video). Both (6) and (7) sug-
gest that visiting is primarily a social occasion, but when Audrey visits her bank, it
may be for a business meeting, for a brief period of time. Finally, to visit Madagas-
car, Audrey must have been gone for a fairly long time, and must have been con-
tinually in Madagascar during the visit. Furthermore, she obviously did not socially
interact with ‘‘Madagascar,’’ but viewed the countryside, met the people, ate the
food (or tried to avoid it), and so on. There is nothing particularly insightful or un-
usual in these observations. They simply point out that a word placed into different
sentences can yield very different interpretations. So, it is a mistake to think that one
can store a single word meaning that will exhaust the word’s significance in most
contexts.
Cruse (1986, p. 52) describes the process of contextual modulation as ‘‘. . . A sin-
gle sense can be modified in an unlimited number of ways by different contexts, each
context emphasising certain semantic traits, and obscuring or suppressing others.’’
Consider the following example (based on one of Cruse’s):
(10) Carl poured the butter over the vegetables.
Here, we clearly understand the butter to be liquid, and therefore hot. As Cruse
points out, however, it is unlikely that we have distinguished these different aspects
of butter in our lexical entry for the word butter. We could make innumerable dis-
tinctions between different forms of butter, but we don’t have one lexical entry for
butter that is cold and solid, another that is hot and melted, one that is in a big stick,
one that is molded into little pieces shaped like leaves, and so on. Similarly, we may
not have different entries in our mental dictionaries for visit in which one is a con-
tinuous, short social occasion, another is a long-term, discontinuous social occasion,
another is a short, continuous business occasion, and so on. At least some of these
contextual modulations are probably derived on the fly.
Murphy and Andrew (1993; see also chapter 12) asked subjects to provide syno-
nyms or antonyms for adjectives. The words, however, were presented as parts of
phrases, such as fresh water, fresh air, fresh bread, and so on. The results showed
that the antonyms and synonyms supplied changed depending on the other word
in the phrase. For example, a synonym for fresh water might be spring water, yet
clearly spring bread is not a synonym for fresh bread. The adjective fresh seems to
take on somewhat more specific meanings depending on the noun it modifies. The
specific meanings led subjects to provide different synonyms in different contexts.
Word Meaning 417
The effects of context, as noted in Cruse’s examples, or in Roth and Shoben’s
experiment, give evidence for a knowledge-based interpretation process. Roth and
Shoben’s subjects apparently believe that secretaries are more likely to drink tea
than milk during their breaks; and they also believe that people are more likely to
have milk with donuts than tea. This kind of information is part of our general
knowledge of beverages, donuts, social activities in an office, and so on. Such infor-
mation must become readily available from hearing the word during sentence com-
prehension. Similarly, Murphy and Andrew (1993) discussed examples that suggest
that the antonyms and synonyms that subjects provided were not based on simple
lexical associations but rather depended on a complex understanding of the situa-
tion being described. For example, one subject gave as a synonym for dry cake the
phrase overcooked cake. Although dry and overcooked are clearly not synonyms in
general (most dry things have never been cooked, much less overcooked), a cake
could become dry through overcooking. So, this person accessed knowledge about
the possible causes of a cake being dry in this apparently purely linguistic task of
providing a synonym. (See also Ho¨ rmann’s 1983 experiments on the interpretations
of quantified phrases like a few crumbs and a few children.)
Modulation is also found in verbs. Gentner and France (1988) presented subjects
with simple subject-verb sentences that were somewhat anomalous, such as ‘‘The
lizard worshipped’’ or ‘‘The responsibility softened.’’ Often such sentences can be
understood if one or more parts are interpreted metaphorically. Gentner and France
found, using a number of different measures, that the verb was much more likely to
be interpreted metaphorically or undergo some other kind of meaning change than
the noun was. For example, one paraphrase for ‘‘The lizard worshipped’’ was ‘‘The
chameleon stared at the sun in a daze.’’ Here, lizard is interpreted literally, but
worship has been changed so that it is something that a lizard might do. The
authors propose that nouns have more cohesive meanings, at least when they refer
to objects like lizards and cars. Verbs are often more relational and so are more
susceptible to their meanings being stretched by the objects that they relate. Another
reason, which the authors didn’t consider, has to do with word order. Since the
word lizard appears first, with no context to suggest that it has anything other than
its expected meaning, readers may be less likely to try to reinterpret it. In contrast,
worship appears later and so may have to adjust itself to the meanings that have
already been evoked.
Cruse (1986, p. 152) also suggests that contextual modification is greater for
verbs and adjectives, because their meanings depend on the nouns that they are
associated with. Saying that John crawled across the floor does not describe the same motion as saying that a centipede did. However, whether there is more or less
such modification for nouns vs. adjectives and verbs is very hard to say. For exam-
ple, Cruse (p. 74) also points out that nouns can have different interpretations in
contexts, as in (I have added some examples to his):
(11) the handle of . . .
a door
a drawer
a suitcase
an umbrella
a sword
a saw
a shopping bag
a car door
As can be seen, the precise shape, function, and material making up these handles
differs greatly, but this information can only be determined by the subsequent
prepositional phrase. Thus, although verbs and adjectives may change their precise
meaning depending on what they describe, nouns can undergo considerable con-
textual modulation as well. 11
Throughout the linguistic literature, there has been a debate on whether the lexi-
con is more like a dictionary or an encyclopedia. That is, does the meaning asso-
ciated with dog include only the most critical (perhaps ‘‘defining’’) information
relevant to the use of this word, or does it include the entire store of what we know
about dogs? The concept view I have been proposing is closer to the encyclopedia
view, because the concept of dog is what we know about dogs in the world, rather
than some specifically linguistic information. However, this does not mean that
every piece of information that one knows about dogs is actually retrieved and used
every time one hears the word dog. One reason for taking an encyclopedic view,
however, is to account for contextual modulation of the sort described here. For
example, one can only know that the handle of a sword is a long thing, continuous
with the sword’s blade, by using one’s knowledge of what swords are usually like.
Similarly, the handle of a shopping bag is likely to be made of string or plastic, and
to be an enclosed semicircular shape. We know this through our world knowledge
of shopping bags. (Not very long ago, the expression ‘‘handle of a shopping bag’’
would have described something made of string, whereas now it would probably be
made of plastic. This is a change in the world, which is reflected in our concepts of
shopping bags, which thereby changes our interpretation of the phrase.)
Word Meaning 419
Through the years, many linguists have become very exercised about the distinc-
tion between ‘‘real’’ (dictionary) meaning and other aspects of meaning that they
thought were not truly linguistic. Such researchers might claim that the difference
between the different kinds of handles is not one of linguistic meaning, but of
something else (reference, discourse models, or interpretation). However, there is no
psychological evidence supporting this distinction. If you eliminate the encyclopedic
knowledge, pure dictionary meaning has great trouble in explaining the phenomena
discussed here: how polysemy is resolved, how contextual modulation occurs, and
how people come to more specific meanings for sentences than the linguistic mean-
ings of individual words include. These are all important processes that must be
dealt with in almost every utterance. (Keep in mind that conceptual variables are
only part of the answer to these problems, as conversational interaction also plays a
part.) Thus, it is not the case that ‘‘real’’ meaning is somehow more important than
the encyclopedic meaning, because both must be invoked to explain comprehen-
sion. To my mind, this debate has become a dated terminological dispute, in which
writers try to argue that some information is, but other information is not, part of
the linguistic meaning of a word based on their prior theories of semantics instead of
any empirical motivation. Nonetheless, even writers who believe that meaning is (or
should be) like a dictionary must admit that real-world knowledge has enormous
effects on how sentences in actual utterances are interpreted. Until there is clear evi-
dence that the dictionary meaning is accessed and used separately from the ency-
clopedic meaning, there is little psychological point in distinguishing them. More
detailed reviews of this debate may be found in many standard discussions of se-
mantics and psycholinguistics, including Clark and Clark (1977), Cruse (1986),
J. D. Fodor (1977), and Taylor (1995).
The encyclopedic aspect of meaning can be seen in the claim that many words’
meanings only make sense when they are taken in the context of a background of
knowledge and practice that is shared within a community. This point was probably
first made most explicitly in the writing of Fillmore (1982) and was later taken up
by Lakoff (1987). Fillmore pointed out that even when verbs seem to be well defined
by a listing of simple semantic features, they often can only be used properly when it
is understood what kind of situation they were intended to apply in. So, verbs like
buy and sell only make sense in a society that has a conventional notion of eco-
nomic transactions. For example, if I happened to give you a pen at the same time
you gave me a gold coin, I could not describe this as ‘‘I sold my pen to you for a
gold coin.’’ To truly buy and sell something, the actors need to have certain inten-
tions within a system of exchange, and these intentions are difficult to specify, be-
420Chapter 11
cause they take place in the context of an elaborate economic system. In another
example, J. A. Fodor (1981) pointed out that the verb paint does not simply mean to
cause paint to be applied to a surface. For example, if I put a small bomb in a jar of
paint, and it blew up all over Jerry Fodor, I should not say ‘‘The bomb painted Jerry
Fodor.’’ This is not the notion of painting one has in mind. Rather, painting takes
place within a general idea of decoration and protection of surfaces, in which the
paint is carefully applied by an agent to a given surface in order to achieve certain
results. Other physical actions that might happen to result in the same effect would
not really be called painting, because they are not done within the context of deco-
ration that is assumed when talking about painting. 12
In a final example, the word bachelor applies within a societal system in which
men and women normally marry at a certain age. In this frame, a bachelor is a man
who is eligible to marry but never has. But the Pope is an eligible adult male, and yet
he does not seem to be a very good bachelor. Similarly, a gay male couple that has
been together for 15 years does not seem to consist of two bachelors, even though
they fit the definition. In both cases, the primary features of the word are fulfilled,
but the assumptions and background underlying the word are not, as the people
have removed themselves from the normal assumptions of marriage as it has tradi-
tionally occurred in our society—the Pope, by virtue of having taken a vow of
chastity, the gay couple by their sexual orientation.
Thus, there is an argument to be made that word meanings cannot fully be rep-
resented by typical feature lists used to describe a single concept. These lists pre-
suppose a certain understanding of the domain, and they only apply within that
framework. For those of us who live within that framework, it can be very difficult
to see its importance to the word’s meaning, because its assumptions are not ex-
plicitly represented in each word, but within our overall conceptual structure. In
short, word meanings may rely on more complex kinds of assumptions and knowl-
edge than one might think on first glance.
The same thing can be found in concepts more generally. For example, we might
tell a child that a dog is something that barks and has four legs. This is sufficient to
pick out many dogs. However, we realize that if we were to take a cow and modify
it so that it barked, or if we were to build a four-legged mechanical robot, we would
not actually have a dog. Instead, a number of deep biological properties are involved
in making something a dog or cat—biological properties responsible in part for
generating the four legs and barking. People are sensitive to these properties even if
they can’t explicitly state them (Keil 1989). Such background knowledge is exactly
the sort of thing emphasized by the knowledge approach to concepts and reviewed
Word Meaning 421
in chapter 6. So, the claims made by Fillmore and others about word meaning are
consistent with this approach to concepts.

Associative-Computational Approaches to Word Meaning
I have been focusing on a conceptual approach to word meaning here, but this has
not always been the major approach to word meaning in linguistics and psychology.
Given the nature of this book, it is not possible to do justice to the history of psy-
chological models of meaning or to fully discuss alternative views. However, one
general approach that has been important in the history of psychology has been
based on word associations. That is, the meaning of a word is the set of other words
(or perhaps words plus other mental entities) it is associated to. This approach has
become more prominent again, due to some high-profile computational models that
use text association to specify the meaning of a word. These approaches may seem
at odds with the conceptual view proposed in the present chapter, and so I will
review and critique them here.
Past Computational Models of Meaning
Before discussing the newest associative model, it is useful to consider early compu-
tational models of meaning and why they were found to be inadequate. Charles
Osgood and his colleagues (e.g., Osgood, Suci, and Tanenbaum 1957) made one of
the first quantitative attempts to measure meaning by asking subjects to rate words
on 50 different scales of adjective contrasts, such as happy-sad or slow-fast. This test
was called the semantic differential. A quantitative analysis showed that the 50 scales
could be effectively reduced (through a factor analysis) to three orthogonal factors,
which Osgood et al. called evaluative (e.g., good-bad), potency (e.g., strong-weak),
and activity (e.g., tense-relaxed). Many words could be distinguished based on their
values on these scales, and experimental work showed that words with similar
scores were behaviorally similar in some respects. Furthermore, once the three fac-
tors were identified, Osgood et al. were able to find specific scales that measured
each one, so that each word would not have to be rated on all 50 scales. This pro-
cedure could not be a total representation of meaning simply because it does not
provide the information necessary to tell one when to use a word and what the word
means when it is used. For example, if you didn’t know the word zork but did know
its values on the three scales (slightly negative, somewhat active, very potent), you
wouldn’t have a clue what to call a zork or what someone was talking about when
they mentioned zorks to you. The three factors are far too vague to represent the
422 Chapter 11
many components of word meaning. 13 In spite of this shortcoming, Osgood’s work
was very well known, because it was one of the first attempts to quantitatively
model semantic information.
A more general and potentially useful attempt to represent meaning came about
with the development of scaling procedures in the 1960s, such as multidimensional
scaling and various clustering techniques. These procedures require information
about the similarity of different words, which was most often obtained by asking
subjects to rate the similarity of pairs of words. For example, how similar are dog
and cow? dog and cat? cow and cat? and so on. These similarities between all pairs
of words being studied would be input into a program, which would output a
structure. In the case of multidimensional scaling, this structure would be a similarity
space. That is, it would create something like a map in which words were the points,
and the distance between them represented how similar they are. An example is
shown for a set of food names in figure 11.3 (from data reported by Ross and
Murphy 1999).
There are two general ways to interpret such scaling solutions. The first is to look
for interpretations of the dimensions. Is there some overall difference between the
items on the left and the items on the right and between the items on the top and
those on the bottom? Sometimes one can find a consistent difference, which would
suggest that this dimension is an important one in people’s representations of the
words. (One can also rotate the entire solution, since the model only determines the
distances between the items, not the specific orientation of the whole solution.
Rotating the solution can often reveal meaningful dimensions.) For example, Di-
mension 2 in figure 11.3 might represent the time when these foods are normally
eaten. Breakfast foods appear at the top, and dinner entrees at the bottom, with
desserts and snacks in between. Foods that might be eaten with any meal (like water,
milk, and butter) are in the middle. In a famous use of multidimensional scaling,
Rips, Shoben, and Smith (1973) found that mammals differed primarily in size and
ferocity. On one dimension, mice and cats differed from deer and bear (size), but on
another dimension, the cat appeared with the lion and bear but was distant from
vegetarians like sheep and cows. When one can find interpretable dimensions (which
is not always the case), it suggests that this kind of variation is important in the
domain under investigation.
Another use of such solutions is to look for clusters of objects. In figure 11.3, one
can clearly see groups of meats, sweets, fruit, vegetables, and breakfast foods that
are fairly distinct from the other clusters. In some cases, these clusters correspond to
obvious categories that might well have been guessed in advance (like fruit and meats), but in others, there might be surprising groupings that would not have been
expected (like breakfast foods).
When such techniques were developed, there was some hope that they could pro-
vide a more quantitative basis for representing word meaning. One could find un-
derlying bases for word meaning that subjects might not overtly express, and one
might also discover surprising clusters of words that one did not realize would go
together. In fact, both of these things do happen with some of these techniques.
However, they also have severe limitations as representations of word meaning.
One of the limitations is much like the one described for the semantic differential,
namely that the solutions obtained simply do not represent much of the meaning.
Typically, multidimensional scaling, for example, results in two to four dimensions.
However, word meaning is extremely complex, and no small set of dimensions can
account for how words are used. For example, even if the scaling solution suggests
that muffins and cereal are thought of as breakfast foods, this does not explain what
the differences are between them, what should be called a muffin as opposed to
cereal, that cereal usually has milk poured on it, but muffins do not, and so on. All
of this information is used in deciding when to use the words muffin and cereal, but
it cannot all be represented in such scaling solutions. Similarly, although pigs and
goats are similar on the size and predacity dimensions, they differ greatly on other
dimensions, which was not revealed in Rips et al.’s solution. If people only knew
what the solution shows, they couldn’t distinguish actual pigs and goats. In short,
scaling solutions often do not provide sufficient detail to account for people’s
semantic knowledge.
Another limitation is that the solutions obtained depend greatly on the particular
set of items tested. For example, Rips et al. tested only mammals and found that size
and predacity were important dimensions. However, if they had tested only plant-
eating animals, it is likely that predacity would no longer be a dimension, and some
other difference among the animals would have become more salient and would
have appeared in the solution (e.g., domesticated vs. wild), even though it was not
present in Rips et al.’s original solution. The scaling solutions are context sensitive
for two reasons. First, people’s similarity judgments are context sensitive. If one is
judging many different kinds of foods, muffins and cereal may seem quite similar.
However, if one were judging only breakfast foods, muffins and cereal would now
seem quite different, as the differences between baked goods and loose cereals would
be much more salient. Second, the scaling procedures are also context sensitive in
that they attempt to account for the largest differences in the data. That is, muffins
and cereal are extremely far from lobster and hamburger in people’s judgments, and
Word Meaning 425
the scaling solution must move these items as far apart as possible in order to
account for these differences. Smaller differences within clusters (e.g., bagels are a bit
more similar to bread than to muffins) are not accounted for as well, because they
do not account for as much variance in the ratings. If one were simply to remove the
meats from the data included in figure 11.3, one might find a better representation
of the breakfast foods.
In any case, the result is that quantitative scaling solutions have been useful for
some purposes, especially in exploring unfamiliar domains. However, as a repre-
sentation of people’s knowledge of words, these techniques have not been as helpful
as was originally hoped for when they were developed. Their main problem is that
they do not provide enough detail to account for word use. For reviews of such
scaling techniques, see Van Mechelen et al. (1993) and Shepard (1974). As we will
now see, somewhat different, more powerful techniques have recently been devel-
oped that may overcome the problems of these scaling techniques.
Recent Associative Models of Semantic Memory
Fast processors and large computer memories have spurred the development of
a new form of semantic analysis, called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer
and Dumais 1997) or Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL, Lund and Burgess
1996). This computational technique is based on an associative approach to word
meaning. Associationism has a very long history in psychology, most importantly
dating from the work of British nineteenth-century philosophers who believed that
all thought could be explained by strings of associations. In the early twentieth cen-
tury, associationistic approaches to meaning were popular because they required
reference to little internal cognitive processing. Within the context of American be-
haviorism, the free association task seemed to be an excellent measure of stimulus-
response learning, and many psychologists were able to convince themselves that
actual language production and comprehension were simply a matter of stringing
together longer and longer series of associations. As a result, mental representations
and complex mechanisms would not be needed to explain language use. The failure
of such theories was a major event in the founding of cognitive psychology (Chom-
sky 1959), but associations between words is a fact of life that is still studied (per-
haps over-studied) by many researchers in lexical processing.
The recent associative enterprises go beyond the simple idea that word 1 is con-
nected to word 2 by an associative link. They suggest that a word can be charac-
terized by its entire set of associations to all other words. That is, people are exposed
to tens of thousands of word types, 14 within millions of sentences that they read and
426 Chapter 11
hear. Certain words tend to occur together and other words hardly ever co-occur in
people’s experience. On this view, these patterns of co-occurrence represent mean-
ing: Words with similar patterns have similar meanings.
Both the models mentioned above use very large text corpora as sources of infor-
mation about how words are associated. For example, Landauer and Dumais (1997)
input 4.6 million words from a student encyclopedia to their LSA model, finding
60,768 word types. They calculated how often each word type occurred with each
other word type in the same article in the encyclopedia, creating a 60,768  60,768
matrix of co-occurrences. (Lund and Burgess’s technique weights co-occurrence
scores by how close the two words are in the text.) A complicated mathematical
technique was used to reduce this matrix to a more reasonable size of 300 dimen-
sions. (Burgess and colleagues do not always reduce the matrix.) Each word had a
value on each of these 300 dimensions, which represented the association informa-
tion in the entire text. Using these dimensions, the semantic similarity between two
words can be calculated as the cosine between the two vectors (a bit like a correla-
tion, going from 1 to 1, showing how similar the two words are across these
dimensions). Words with nearly identical patterns of co-occurrences would have
cosines near 1, whereas those with orthogonal patterns would have cosines of 0.
Why should this work? That is, why should this procedure result in a measure
of semantic similarity? Some words that occur together often are not semantically
similar. For example, knife and butter might co-occur pretty often, but they are
semantically very different. However, LSA does not use only the information about
how often knife and butter occur together but also how often they occur with all the
other words in the corpus. For example, butter might occur with a lot of other foods
on shopping lists or in discussion of dairy products, and knife would not occur in
such lists. Similarly, knife might occur with other words describing weapons or
cutting, and butter would not occur with such words. Because LSA looks at the
entire pattern of co-occurrences, it tends to find that words are similar if they are
found in similar sentences, and, it is hoped, this will be a good measure of semantic
similarity.
Landauer and Dumais (1997) and Lund and Burgess (1996) report a number of
experiments and tests of their models, some of which are fairly impressive. Landauer
and Dumais tested their system on a synonym test from the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL), which is used as a college admission test for nonnative
speakers of English at American universities. The model got 64.4% correct, which
was almost identical to the performance of a large sample of college applicants
who took the test. Although these applicants did not all know English very well,
Word Meaning 427
Landauer and Dumais report that such a score would allow admission to many
American universities. Lund, Burgess, and Atchley (1995) showed that their model
can predict results in word priming experiments of the sort that are often performed
in the study of lexical access. In an extremely controversial move, Landauer and his
colleagues are adapting LSA to be used as an automatic grading tool for student
papers. Essentially, the more the pattern of lexical co-occurrences in the student
paper is like that of the course materials, the higher the student’s grade. There is
evidence that the model may have some validity as a measure of the amount of
learning (see Wolfe et al. 1998; and Rehder et al. 1998). A readable article describ-
ing the grading system and including outraged howls of critics who object to grad-
ing by machine may be found in Thompson (1999).
The success of such models could be taken as undermining the conceptual ap-
proach to meaning taken in this chapter. If these models can truly account for how
words are used, then word meaning may be a large associative network that merely
encodes patterns of co-occurrence. Landauer and Dumais (1997) suggest that such a
network would help to explain how it is that children are able to acquire so many
words so quickly. When an unfamiliar word appears in a sentence context, children
can assume that it is similar in meaning to other words that have appeared in similar
contexts. Because the only input to the model is words, meaning would be repre-
sented through links to other words rather than through the knowledge underlying
those words—that is, concepts. LSA’s success in some tests may indicate that con-
ceptual information is simply not that necessary to explaining meaning.
Before we get too carried away, however, we need to see more of the semantic
structures that these models create. Landauer and Dumais do not provide examples
of the semantic structures that their model arrives at (a fact that is itself worrisome).
Lund and Burgess (1996, table 2) are more helpful. In their text base (consisting of
160 million words from newsgroup messages), the closest neighbors to jugs were the
words juice, butter, vinegar, bottles, and cans. The closest neighbors to monopoly
were threat, huge, moral, gun, and large. (A later paper by Burgess, Livesay, and
Lund 1998, suggests that these kinds of neighborhoods are common.) Clearly, these
words are related in some ways to their neighbors. However, the meaning of jugs
is simply not similar to the meaning of juice, butter, or vinegar; monopoly is not
semantically like threat or gun. Even though monopolies are large, and may be con-
sidered a threat, the fact that these two words are related to monopoly is not very
informative. Is the monopoly a threat, or is someone threatening it? Who is it a
threat to, and how does it threaten them? If one just knows that monopoly and
428 Chapter 11
threat are ‘‘similar,’’ one does not really understand what monopolies are and do.
Similarly, are monopolies large like elephants or buildings, or like something else?
There is nothing in this set of neighbors specifying that a monopoly is an illegal
activity by a company that controls a certain commodity in order to unfairly raise
prices for it and stifle competition. Once one knows this, one can easily understand
how monopolies are large (in the sense of controlling nearly the entire supply of the
commodity), are threats (to other companies or to consumers, but in economic
terms), might not be moral (why isn’t immoral the related term?), and so on. Having
the concept explains why these words are related, rather than vice versa.
The general problem with nets of associations is that knowing what words are
associated to one another does not specify what the meaning of an individual word
is. First, there is an overall problem that one simply cannot understand the meanings
of words by reference to other words (as discussed by Johnson-Laird 1983, for ex-
ample). If one only knows dog by its similarity to cat and cow and bone . . . and cat
by its similarity to dog and cow and bone . . . and cow by its similarity to cat and
dog and bone . . . and so on, one is caught in a circle of similar words. One simply
does not know enough from similarities to other words to know what should be
called cat and what dog. Words must be connected to our knowledge of things in
the world, not just other words.
A more specific problem is that the model does not specify the basis for each as-
sociation. Although jugs may be related to both vinegar and bottles, these relations
are extremely different, and an overall similarity score does not represent these dif-
ferences. One wouldn’t know from the scores that ‘‘Put it in the jugs’’ is similar to
‘‘Put it in the bottles’’ but not ‘‘Put it in the vinegar.’’ Apparently the similarity score
is good enough to allow LSA to pass a synonym test or even to grade student
papers, but it will not be enough to represent the very detailed knowledge people
have about the referents of words, which is used in speech and comprehension.
These shortcomings are exactly the things that the conceptual approach does well.
Since concepts are our nonlinguistic representation of the world, by connecting
words to these representations, we can explain how people can connect sentences
and words to objects and events in the world. Concepts are just the things that are
evoked by our perceptual systems and that control our actions. Thus, by hooking up
words to concepts, we can break out of the circle of words connected to words and
tie language to perception and action. Furthermore, since one’s concept of a jug,
say, would include detailed information about its origins, parts, materials, functions,
and so on, the concept is more than sufficient to distinguish the meaning of jugs
Word Meaning 429
from that of vinegar and, for that matter, bottles, and it directly represents the in-
formation that allows one to see that jug and bottle are near synonyms, but jug and
vinegar are not.
In short, even the more recent associationistic approaches do not cast doubt on
the overall conceptual approach I have been proposing here. I think that it is likely
that children can learn words by using the context that novel words appear in, as
Landauer and Dumais (1997) argue. And it is certainly possible that a system that
accumulates massive numbers of associations through a large text base will be able
to do a number of useful tasks. However, as a psychological model of word use, the
associationistic approaches do not seem likely to replace the conceptual approach.
These programs are still new (as of this writing), and it is possible that they will
overcome what now appear to be shortcomings. For example, the accuracy of the
models’ behavior depends greatly on how many words they are exposed to. It is
only with very large samples of text that they can accurately represent the meaning
of individual words. Although they have in fact been run on large text corpora,
the sizes of these corpora are still much less than the verbal experience of a college
student, say. So, perhaps with a few more hundred exposures to real-life occurrences
of jugs, HAL would no longer list it as being similar to vinegar. However, it is im-
portant for contrast to remember that children can figure out much of the meaning
of a word from a single reference, which arguably provides better information than
even thousands of word co-occurrences.
Another possibility is that (again, with sufficient input) the 300 dimensions that
LSA uses could turn out to be meaningful semantic dimensions. That is, rather than
just providing a global measure of similarity between cat and horse, LSA might
allow us to examine the dimensions on which they are similar and dissimilar and
thereby specify the properties of cats and horses. For example, dimension 129 might
be size, and cat might have a moderately low value on that; and dimension 212
might be tail, and both cat and horse might have high values on that. Although
current implementations of such systems do not generally result in many interpret-
able dimensions, it is again possible that future versions will. If so, then we might be
able to use LSA representations to derive more familiar conceptual representations
of feature lists or schemata. And unlike Osgood’s semantic differential, or most
scaling procedures, the large number of dimensions used in LSA could conceivably
be enough to represent many different aspects of meaning. At that point, LSA would
not necessarily be a different theory of word meaning but could be seen as a way of
implementing conceptual knowledge. In the meantime, such models do not pose a
threat to the conceptual approach to meaning. 

Linguistic Determinism
One of the most popular issues in the psychology of thought and language is
whether our concepts are determined by the language we speak. This notion of
linguistic determinism is often called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (usually shortened
to the Whorfian hypothesis). A complete account of the history of the psychology of
meaning would give considerable coverage to this theory. However, this view has
had little concrete support and as a result has had little influence on psychological
theories of word meaning, regardless of its hold on the public’s imagination.
In everyday life, one often hears statements of the sort ‘‘Eskimos have 50 different
words for snow,’’ along with the suggestion that this makes them see and think
about snow differently than do, say, people living in New Jersey. Such a statement
is a kind of arctic legend rather than a claim about a specific language (e.g., what
Eskimos exactly are being talked about, what language, and what exactly are the
words?), and it seems, insofar as one can tell with such legends, not to be true
(Pullum 1991). But this claim can serve as a prototypical example of the idea that
languages differ in ways that might influence thought. Similarly, when one travels,
one may notice that people in different lands think about some things differently
than we do. And if one learns the language, one sees that they also have a somewhat
different way of talking about those things—often having more or fewer words,
using different metaphoric expressions, or dividing up the world differently than
English does. All this can lead to the conclusion that when learning one’s native
language, one’s thoughts are largely determined. That is, when learning English,
one learns only the single word snow, and so one sees snow as being one kind
of thing; when learning Eskimo, one must now see 50 different things instead of
just snow. The idea is that our concepts are fairly malleable relative to language,
which is imposed by one’s culture, and which no single individual can change very
easily. As a result, language acquisition forces a certain conceptual structure on the
individual.
There is certainly a note of plausibility to this story. As pointed out earlier, during
language acquisition, children are forced to learn distinctions that they might not
have spontaneously noticed, because the word meanings depend on them. Although
children would probably notice the difference between geese and ducks at some
point, their parents’ use of two different labels for these birds can accelerate the
process. However, behind such straightforward examples lie some much stronger
claims that are more controversial. For example, in saying that language determines
thought, is one saying that people cannot notice the distinction unless it is in the
Word Meaning 431
language? Such a statement would clearly be too strong. Indeed, as I have just
reviewed, most content words have different senses, which refer to things that are
different, but that we perfectly well distinguish, such as table referring to a kind of
furniture and to the people who are seated at such a piece of furniture. We are not
fooled by the use of a common name to treat these things identically (e.g., try to
polish the people or to feed the furniture). The importance of polysemy within a
language is seldom recognized when considering differences between languages. If
words had such a large effect on our concepts, one would not expect to have such
drastically different senses referred to by the same word within a language.
Even to say that people would find it harder to notice distinctions that are not
marked in the language is a strong claim. So far as I know, there is no verified result
that shows this difference (see below). Sometimes the existence of different names
is itself taken as evidence for cognitive or perceptual differences: How could the
Eskimos use 50 different words for snow unless they had 50 different concepts, in
contrast to our one concept? However, this is obviously a completely circular argu-
ment. To demonstrate an effect of language on cognition, there must be some
evidence that Eskimos conceive of snow differently than those who have a more
snow-deprived vocabulary, and that evidence should be a nonlinguistic task.
Furthermore, consider the question of why these linguistic differences come about.
Why is it that the Eskimos happen to have 50 different names for snow? Why do the
French have 100 different terms for the taste of wine (using another example heard
on the street)? If linguistic determinism is true, then it would just be an accident
of the language. That is, the Eskimo language happens to have a lot of names for
snow, and therefore Eskimo children are forced to form many different concepts of
snow, whereas French children are off the hook as regards snow, but are arbitrarily
forced to learn the wine terms. (The French seem to have the better end of the deal.)
However, these linguistic differences have very good nonlinguistic reasons. For
example, if Eskimos did have 50 words for snow (again, see Pullum 1991), this is
likely because they live in a very snowy area and need to make different distinctions
in order to carry out their everyday activities. And France has many more varieties
of wine than do the Northern Territories. Historically, then, it seems much more
likely that their activities and thoughts determined the vocabulary than vice versa.
Furthermore, even within English, there are experts who have many different words
for snow, namely skiers. Clearly, this is not due to linguistic determinism either
(given that standard English doesn’t include these terms) but arose through the need
of skiers to communicate different qualities of snow to one another. They wanted to
communicate these qualities because different types of snow have different implica-
432 Chapter 11
tions for skiing, such as whether it is fast or slow and whether one can steer on it.
It was the need to describe known distinctions that drove the development of a
vocabulary, rather than vocabulary determining the concepts skiers have.
In spite of this discussion, one might argue that for a child born into a society
where the vocabulary makes certain distinctions, the child is stuck with learning
those distinctions and with not learning others that could be made. And so, even if
historically the vocabulary came about through conceptual reasons rather than vice
versa, the child must learn the language now, and, as a result, the child’s concepts
are driven by the language. Nonetheless, there is very little evidence that language
changes our perception of things in a very deep way, independently of experience
and societal interests. This has been most studied within the domain of color. For
example, people who come from a language with only two color names (essentially
light and dark) appear to have color perception and memory similar to people who
know many color names, like English speakers (Rosch 1973). The perceptual struc-
ture of color space and processing of colors in memory do not seem to rely on lan-
guage. Linguistic determinism has also been studied in more complex nonperceptual
domains such as counterfactuals, statements about events that did not occur, such as
‘‘If I had won the lottery, I would have paid my rent.’’ Although some languages
distinctively mark counterfactuals and others do not, this does not turn out to in-
fluence their speakers’ counterfactual reasoning, in spite of claims to the contrary
(Au 1983).
There is strong resistance to giving up the notion of linguistic determinism in
some circles. For example, Lucy (1992) gave a book-long defense of the Whorfian
hypothesis, which largely amounted to criticizing all the evidence that had been
found against it. However, his defense could not cite actual, strong evidence in favor
of the hypothesis—it could only attack the evidence contradicting it. Surely this is
very weak support for a scientific hypothesis.
If there is any truth to linguistic determinism, I think that it is most likely to be in
simpler domains than the ones typically studied in the psychology of concepts. Re-
cent writers on linguistic determinism have emphasized the importance of gramma-
ticized features rather than lexical domains like words for snow and wine tastes (see
Gumperz and Levinson 1996; Lucy 1992). For example, Slobin (1996) points out
that verbs in Turkish are marked for whether the speaker directly observed the
action or only knows about it second hand. Turkish speakers therefore must keep
track of this information when speaking, and perhaps do so in general. I have heard
Chinese speakers complain that they found it annoying to have to continually keep
track of everyone’s gender, so that they could distinguish he and she when speaking
Word Meaning 433
English. The fact that I don’t find this difficult may indicate that English has focused
my attention on gender more than Chinese would have. Finally, Bowerman (1996)
points out that speakers of Tzeltal, a Mayan language, must use different verbs to
say that X is on Y, depending on X’s shape. Perhaps Tzeltal speakers focus on shape
or even perceive it somewhat differently than English speakers.
All of these things may well be true, though most of them do not have direct,
nonlinguistic evidence to support the notion that language has changed speakers’
concepts. 16 These grammaticized distinctions are often based on broadly applied
features (like gender, spatial relations, or plurality) instead of conceptual informa-
tion relevant to the domains that we have been focusing on (animals, plants, arti-
facts), and they may result in greater attention or emphasis placed on some of the
relevant features, rather than a change in conceptual organization. For example,
Chinese speakers clearly categorize people in terms of gender, but perhaps English
speakers do so faster and even in situations when it is not very relevant, because of
their need to specify gender in personal pronouns. This would be a quantitative
rather than a qualitative difference.
Another possibility, proposed by Slobin (1996), is that when people are planning
to speak, they attend to the categories that their language requires in order to plan
their utterances. For some languages, this will be plurality, gender, or tense; for
other languages, it will be object shape, social distance, or the duration of the event.
However, when simply observing events or in their general knowledge about the
world, people may be little influenced by these same properties.
Discussions of linguistic determinism in the past have given rise to more heat
than light, and the topic is still emotionally charged for many. At this point, I think
that some good ideas and good techniques for studying linguistic determinism have
been developed. However, the core evidence that one would want for linguistic
determinism—adequate description of linguistic differences, followed by indepen-
dent demonstrations of parallel conceptual differences—is still largely lacking. The
newer approaches represented in the Gumperz and Levinson (1996) book hold out
some promise that such evidence will be found, if it exists. However, the domains
being looked at by such researchers are not closely related to the main topics inves-
tigated in the psychology of concepts, and so it is still an open question about how
much language determines adult concepts of objects, events, and so on.
In this context, it is interesting to consider a proposition that is essentially the
opposite of the Whorfian hypothesis, that certain linguistic categories are due to
universal conceptual and communicative constraints. For example, it is often said
that nouns and verbs are found in every language, and adjectives in most languages.
434 Chapter 11
But how does one identify the category of noun in different languages? One can at-
tempt to answer this question syntactically: Nouns are things that take plural and
case markings, whereas verbs take tense or aspect markings. However, even this
is problematic, as different languages have different syntactic rules for the parts of
speech. For example, Chinese does not normally inflect nouns for the plural, and
English does not use case markings, whereas Latin does both. How can we say,
then, that Chinese, English, and Latin all have the syntactic category of nouns? The
traditional answer has been a semantic one, that nouns refer to persons, places, or
things, verbs refer to actions or events, and adjectives refer to properties. However,
this basis is not perfect either, as some nouns refer to events or properties, like the
party or whiteness, and some adjectives refer to entities, like corporate.
Croft (1991) suggests an interesting resolution to this problem. He argues that
nouns, adjectives, and verbs arise from a basic communicative need to refer to en-
tities, to modify those references, and to predicate something about those entities,
respectively. Therefore, there is a semantic core to nounness and verbhood, based on
typical properties of objects and predicates. But rather than a well-defined category,
these are prototype categories, with the typical objects and events at their center,
and less typical things at the periphery. The particular syntactic properties of each
category are related to these conceptual differences, Croft argues. For example,
nouns are often inflected for number, topicality, and case, whereas verbs are often
inflected for tense and aspect. This is because objects can be counted, are often the
topics of conversation, and have different relations to one another, whereas verbs
often refer to actions, which happen at a particular time and have other process
distinctions (being complete or incomplete; being essentially instantaneous or lasting
for some time) marked by tense and aspect. As a result, it is no coincidence that
English and Spanish both mark nouns for plurality and have verbs that are marked
for tense. It is our basic concepts of objects, event, and properties that lead lan-
guages to tend to have similar morpho-syntactic properties. Croft also notes that
items that are semantically dissimilar to the category prototypes also often fail to
have the typical syntactic properties. For example, although whiteness and water are
both syntactically nouns, they cannot be pluralized, because they do not refer to
objects.
In summary, Croft’s analysis suggests that language may reflect conceptual uni-
versals. Rather than concepts following language, some linguistic structures may
arise from conceptual structures combined with communicative needs. I cannot do
justice to Croft’s theory here, but it provides an interesting contrast to the Whorfian
emphasis on the reverse direction of influence.
Final Summary of the Conceptual Approach
After all the discussions, arguments, and data presented in this chapter, where does
this leave us with regard to the relation between concepts and word meaning? It is
clear that conceptual structures are deeply involved in word meaning, given all the
conceptual effects found in language use and learning. However, the simple relations
depicted in figures 11.1 and 11.2 do not adequately represent the relation, as they
do not account for phenomena such as polysemy and contextual modulation. An
attempt at a more complete picture is made in figure 11.4, but it must be admitted
Figure 11.4
A final attempt to illustrate how word meanings are built out of concepts.
436 Chapter 11
that a complete model of word meaning cannot be represented in a simple diagram,
because the number of variables and complexity of the structures involved precludes
a simple depiction. In the figure, the nodes and their connections represent concep-
tual structure, and words are connected to a node or substructure.
The notion here is that an individual (unambiguous) word usually has a number
of different senses, like word 2 in the figure (the others don’t, for purposes of clar-
ity). These senses are overlapping subparts of the conceptual structure. As it is likely
that many of these senses (or at least the most common ones) are explicitly repre-
sented, instead of being derived from a core meaning (Klein and Murphy 2001),
there must be a number of explicitly marked links between the word form and con-
ceptual structures. The meaning of the word then consists in coherent subparts of
conceptual knowledge that are picked out by the lexical item. However, note that
the conceptual component also includes other information from the general domain,
including superordinates, coordinates (nodes that share an immediate superordinate),
and other related concepts. For example, sense 1 of word 2 picks out a single node,
N2, in the conceptual structure. N2 has superordinate N1, coordinates N3 and N4,
and subordinates N5 and N6 represented in the structure. Although such concepts
are not directly picked out by the word, they are important for specifying the meaning
by providing contrast, background knowledge, and underlying assumptions (e.g.,
Fillmore 1982). For example, the exact meaning of the word picking out N2 depends
in part on distinguishing it from the related concepts N3 and N4. And since back-
ground knowledge is apparently critical for categorization and reasoning about
concepts (see chapter 6), word use can draw on such resources as well. Figure 11.4
also attempts to illustrate the general pattern of chaining of word senses, as the parts
of conceptual structure picked out by different senses overlap to a large degree.
Sense 1 of word 2 is included in sense 2, which overlaps with sense 3. There are also
some senses that are not themselves overlapping but are related by intermediate
overlapping senses (like the material and editorial policy senses of the word paper),
as in senses 1 and 3 of word 2 in the figure.
What cannot be represented in such a figure are the processes by which the senses
are identified and represented, the way that related concepts and background
knowledge constrain senses, and the processes by which an interpretation is con-
structed each time a word appears in a particular context. However, figure 11.4
certainly does serve to indicate the complexity of the picture relative to that envi-
sioned in figures 11.1 and 11.2. And in fact, part of the reason concepts have been
criticized as representations of word meaning is, I believe, because researchers
Word Meaning 437
assumed the simple relations of the sort shown in those figures. Unfortunately, the
relation is quite complex, which is hardly surprising when one considers the com-
plexity of word meaning itself.
One particular process that the figure cannot display is how new senses are
derived for a word. For example, if I have only heard the word DVD used to refer
to the physical disks, when I hear a new sentence like ‘‘This DVD is very boring,’’ I
must derive the sense meaning the disk’s content. Imagine that my original sense is
like that of sense 2 of word 2 in the figure, a fairly complex meaning structure indi-
cating a physical device of a certain shape that contains audiovisual content, if
played by a decoder through a TV. However, the ‘‘boring DVD’’ refers only to the
content, a substructure of the original sense, perhaps the node picked out in sense 1
in the figure. Thus, I must be able to shift from understanding the word as referring
to the larger structure to understanding it as referring to a subpart of that structure.
Pustejovsky (1995) formally describes how such operations could be carried out. No
doubt other cases exist in which one must go in the other direction—extending a
word from a narrow sense to a broader one. Understanding the meaning of a word
in context, then involves not only retrieving prestored structures, but more con-
structive processes based on those structures.
Even a model at this level of generality does help us to understand some long-
standing questions in the psychology of word meaning. One question has to do with
whether word meanings are decomposed during use. Theories of semantic repre-
sentation often suggested that word meaning was a list of semantic components
(Katz and Fodor 1963), and therefore theories of comprehension suggested that
understanding consisted of retrieving each word’s components when it was under-
stood. One problem with this is that it is very difficult to provide a simple set of
components that is a word’s meaning, as I have already suggested (in the paint and
buy examples). Rather diffuse background knowledge can be a necessary part of
interpretation even if it does not (and could not) appear in the list of features. An
empirical problem is that words that appear to be more complex, in the sense of
having more components, are not generally more difficult to understand as mea-
sured in a variety of experiments (Johnson-Laird 1981, chapter 10 provides a read-
able review of this literature), though one exception is that negative words are
harder to understand than their positive counterparts (like absent-present, Clark
1974). Nonetheless, it is difficult to understand exactly what it would mean to
comprehend a word if it is not to bring to mind its components. Although some
have proposed that a word meaning is a holistic entity that is not analyzable (J. A.
438 Chapter 11
Fodor 1981), every concrete theory of semantic representation does use components
of some kind, because there is no other obvious way to represent the meaning.
By relating words to conceptual structure, we are now less tempted to talk about
lexical ‘‘decomposition.’’ First, we have acknowledged that a word has a number of
senses—not just one decomposition (see figure 11.4)—and coordinating and select-
ing among those senses is an important aspect of comprehension, which cannot be
predicted by the number of components of the word in general. Second, as figure
11.4 also reveals, the substructure being picked out by the word is not a simple list
of components, but a possibly elaborate structure. It is in general hard to know how
to count up the number of nodes, links, and their relations in order to determine
each word’s overall complexity. One would have to know the structure very pre-
cisely in order to obtain an accurate measure, more precisely than we typically do
know. Third, the conceptual structure being picked out by the word is closely inte-
grated with related structures, and these probably have considerable influence on
the use of the word. For example, the word dog is embedded in biological knowl-
edge of animals in general as well as knowledge of pets, the differences between
dogs and cats, and so forth, and this knowledge might be activated to various de-
grees on some occasions in which one hears the word dog—even though it is not an
‘‘official’’ part of the meaning.
Finally, it is worth pointing out that we need not assume that every aspect of
conceptual knowledge is retrieved when a word is understood. In fact, it would be
very difficult to do so. It has long been known that when a sentence emphasizes one
aspect of a word meaning, that aspect is more activated, and other aspects may not
be activated (McKoon and Ratcliff 1988; Tabossi 1988). So, it is likely that not all
conceptual knowledge associated with a word is retrieved into memory when the
word is encountered, but some knowledge is picked out as being particularly rele-
vant. Thus, one would not always expect more complex words to be harder to un-
derstand than simple words, as the amount of information explicitly encoded would
likely vary across conditions.
Theoretical Implications
The literature on word meaning has not been directed towards distinguishing
theories of concept representation. As a result, the phenomena that have been dis-
cussed here are generally not very probative in evaluating different accounts of how
concepts are represented. For example, although typicality effects have been found
Word Meaning 439
in linguistic data, in sentence comprehension, speech production, and rating studies,
these studies have not investigated whether people’s representations of word mean-
ings are exemplar-based or some kind of prototype representation. (Of course,
such phenomena do reinforce the severe problems with the classical view described
throughout this book.) Often such studies appear to assume a prototype represen-
tation, but it seems likely that exemplar models could explain most of the data just
as easily. For example, if reading the word vehicle activates memories of specific
vehicles, it is more likely that a bus exemplar would be activated than a tank exem-
plar would be. Thus, the Garrod and Sanford (1977) anaphora data could possibly
be accounted for by an exemplar-based representation. Of course, there are some
phenomena that I have already identified as being somewhat problematic for exem-
plar models (e.g., hierarchical classification, see chapter 7), and they are equally
problematic when they are applied to words and word meaning.
The phenomenon of chaining is particularly important here. That is, as empha-
sized by Taylor (1995; and Lakoff 1987), broadly applied words often do not have
a simple prototype structure but can be understood as a chain of meanings that are
pairwise related (e.g., the examples of paper and the juice box discussed above).
This process has a very exemplarish quality to it (as noted by Malt et al. 1999), be-
cause it is similarity to a particular past use that is important, just as exemplar
theory says that it is similarity to known exemplars that is important. However, it is
not yet clear whether the chaining is taking place between exemplars or summary
representations. The plastic cartoon-character juice box is not just similar to a par-
ticular plastic squarish juice box—it is similar to a whole class of such juice boxes.
Perhaps it is because this novel item is similar to a subcategory of boxes (rather than
to an exemplar) that it can be called a box. If plastic juice boxes form a subcategory
of boxes, they might be represented by a prototype-like summary representation of
that subcategory rather than as individual exemplars. So, chaining could involve
either summary representations or exemplars.
Thus, it does not seem that the main phenomena of word meaning can be chalked
up to either the prototype or exemplar model very clearly.
The knowledge approach comes off well in this analysis, however, from a number
of sources. First, it has long been known that in order to understand language, one
must make innumerable plausible inferences to fill in what the speaker or writer
intended to say (e.g., Bransford, Barclay, and Franks 1972; Gibbs 1984; Grice 1975;
Haviland and Clark 1974; Schank and Abelson 1977; among many others). For
example, the sentence ‘‘Carl poured the butter’’ requires one to infer that the butter
must be hot and in liquid form. Such inferences obviously involve our knowledge of
440Chapter 11
the world (e.g., only liquid can be poured, butter is liquid only when melted, and
therefore is hot), which is apparently activated very quickly and continually during
real language comprehension.
Knowledge effects can be seen more specifically in conceptual combination (see
chapter 12), contextual modulation, typicality shifts (Roth and Shoben 1983), deter-
mining the intended sense in polysemy, and the use of background assumptions in
determining word meaning (Fillmore 1982). That is, there is no way to tell from the
word table by itself whether one is talking about the piece of furniture or the col-
lection of people eating dinner. But when embedded in a sentence such as ‘‘The table
left only a 10% tip,’’ there is only one plausible choice—only one choice compatible
with our world knowledge. Although one can argue that such knowledge is not
really part of the word meaning but is more general domain knowledge, it effectively
becomes part of the meaning, because the knowledge is used to determine the spe-
cific interpretation of that word in that context. Indeed, it is in lacking such every-
day knowledge that computerized translation and language comprehension devices
have often had great difficulty, as well as their difficulty in using pragmatics and
knowledge of the speaker. Thus, it can be very difficult to know where to draw the
line between what is part of the word meaning per se and what is ‘‘background’’
knowledge. It is not clear to me that drawing this line will be theoretically useful.
In short, insofar as background knowledge and plausible reasoning are involved
in determining which sense is intended for a polysemous word for contextual mod-
ulation and for drawing inferences in language comprehension, this provides further
evidence that background knowledge is involved in the conceptual representations
underlying word meaning.
