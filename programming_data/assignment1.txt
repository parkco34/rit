Programming Assignment 1
In this program you will be combining what you have learned so far and building an interactive Python
math program. This document will serve as your specifications and so you must adhere to these
requirements. You may (and should) ask for clarifications. You must also adhere to the Python style
guide as described in PEP-8. This includes things like indentation, variable and function names, spacing,
etc.
1. Your program will present the user with a menu that asks about the task to be performed. The
tasks will be taken from a collection of MATH functions.
a. Division
b. Convert a base 10 number to binary
c. Modulo arithmetic (remainder and quotient)
2. At start, your program should provide the users with a greeting and usage message.
3. The user will be able to select from the menu and the task will be performed based on the input
provided by the user for the calculation and implemented using functions. The output must be
organized and readable including whitespace around the request and the answer.
4. After completion, the user is returned to the menu in order to make another choice.
5. The program will exit only when the user decides to exit.
6. Your program must perform input checking to ensure that the user provides proper values. This
should include the proper type for the function called, values and the proper exit command or
character.
7. Your program must include a comment at each section explaining what each does. Include your
name, contact information and class as part of your comments.
8. Much of the code for this assignment can be found online and it is terribly tempting to use this
code as your own. However, you are only permitted to use the tools we have learned up to this
point. Thus, you will also be graded on the type of solutions you provide.
9. Lastly, you are not permitted to use built-in Python functions or methods for any of the MATH
problems â€“ you must write code that performs the calculations using standard operators. These
calculations must have their own functions.
